UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/cpaas/casa25-where-the-future-of-cpaas-takes-centre-stage-in-amsterdam/,29-07-2025,CASA25: Where the Future of CPaaS Takes Centre Stage in Amsterdam,"In an era where programmable communications are wholly rewriting enterprise playbooks, CASA25 lands in Amsterdam at just the right moment. From 22–24 September 2025, this three‑day summit draws together telcos, platform builders, API pioneers and CX strategists; not for staged presentations, but for deep collaboration. If you’re driving CPaaS strategy, from architecture and automation to go‑to‑market growth, CASA25 is where you sharpen your edge.

CASA25 is Where Strategy Meets Substance

Returning to Amsterdam following two sold‑out editions, now at the city’s Tobacco Theater, CASA25 has evolved well beyond a conference and into a curated ecosystem of impact. Over three packed days, attendees will dive into design‑sprint workshops, C‑level panels, and the highly anticipated public premiere of the State of CPaaS 2025 report and its Intelligent Engagement North Star, a practical field guide built for revenue‑ready, AI‑infused communications.

Expect a balanced mix of hands‑on sessions and strategic dialogue, covering topics such as telco‑led Network API monetization, bridging UCaaS/CCaaS with composable CPaaS, and Gen AI powering customer and employee experience. Sponsors and speakers will be drawn from firms like Gamma, Sinch, Infobip, Radisys, GSMA, CM.com, KPN, Vonage, STL Partners, and more. The content will be rooted in real, tangible use cases, centring not on hype but on insight.

By the end of the day, attendees will walk away with new frameworks, vetted partnerships, and the confidence to lead their organizations toward a $100 billion+ CPaaS future.

Why CPaaS in 2025 Demands Attention from Leaders

The stage of experimental CPaaS is well and truly over. It’s go‑time. In 2025, programmable comms extends beyond APIs and is fundamentally about blending AI, network orchestration, and real‑time engagement across channels. For enterprise tech buyers, from CIOs and CTOs to procurement committees, the critical questions now are: How do we scale with control? How do we align with evolving regulation and reliability? How do we make CPaaS central to CX, EX, and transformation agendas?

This summit addresses those questions head‑on. The Intelligent Engagement concept, unveiled at CASA25, reframes CPaaS as a business‑critical asset, embedding AI, automation, and orchestration into revenue‑ready customer journeys. The State of CPaaS 2025 report offers hard data, trend mapping and visionary frameworks to help leaders move beyond tactical deployments to strategic integration.

Meanwhile, service providers and CPaaS platforms face mounting expectations, from seamless UCaaS/CCaaS convergence to compliance, customization, and global delivery. CASA25 enables both sides of the ecosystem to align around real outcomes rather than just flashy features.

UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/hybrid-hype-or-hard-reality-why-it-leaders-must-rethink-collaboration-strategy-now/,06-08-2025,Hybrid Hype or Hard Reality? Why IT Leaders Must Rethink Collaboration Strategy Now,"With employees working across offices, homes, and even during transit – IT leaders face unprecedented challenges.

As hybrid work cements itself as the default model and not a temporary trend, leaders must rethink how they deliver seamless collaboration across varied environments, devices, and user expectations that can span multiple platforms, geographies, and use cases.

“The shift to the hybrid work has fundamentally transformed the way the collaboration happens,” says Vivek Kar, Head of Employee Interaction Suite at Tata Communications.

“Employees also work during transit where the connectivity could be an issue.”

This demands a fresh approach to how IT delivers seamless, secure, and reliable communication experiences across conditions – from traditional office and home environments to any location with variable connectivity.

According to IDC, 93 percent of enterprises now use UC&C applications like video conferencing, team messaging, and screen sharing, highlighting how hybrid collaboration has evolved into a mature, enterprise-wide capability rather than a stopgap pandemic solution.

IT teams must now ensure consistent voice, video, messaging, and file-sharing experiences – even under unstable network conditions.

Meeting this challenge requires flexible solutions that work across devices, time zones, and connection qualities.

Multi-Platform Complexity: Flexibility vs. Manageability

A major hurdle is the reality of multiple UC platforms within the same organization.

Often a result of mergers, legacy systems, or regional preferences, this multi-platform environment creates complexity for IT teams.

However, managing disparate platforms can lead to fragmented user experiences, security vulnerabilities, and increased operational overhead.

A 2024 survey by Metrigy found that 51 percent of organizations consider consolidating UC&C platforms extremely important, with another 24 percent calling it somewhat important.

“Employees, partners and customers often operate across different UC platforms,” said Kar.

“Supporting multiple platforms preserves the user choices and the business agility.”

Empowering Users: Scaling Without Overburdening IT

Central IT teams can easily become overwhelmed managing routine tasks like user onboarding, troubleshooting, and configuration especially in complex multi-platform environments. Kar stresses the importance of decentralizing these tasks:

“User-self service is a foundational element for scalability… IT teams can’t be the bottleneck for routine actions like onboarding, troubleshooting, or configuration.”

By enabling local administrators and end-users with intuitive tools and APIs, organizations can reduce IT workload and accelerate response times.

This shift not only improves efficiency but also enhances user satisfaction by putting control closer to the point of need.

Managed Services: The Strategic Future

With multi-platform collaboration becoming the norm, managed services will need to evolve beyond basic support into strategic partners that provide orchestration, AI-powered analytics, and unified governance.

According to Nemertes Research, 27 percent of enterprises now rank managed services availability among their top three UC&C provider selection criteria, signaling growing expectations for scalable, hands-off support capabilities.

“Managed services will become central to driving faster adoption, optimizing collaboration ROI, and fostering continuous improvement,” Kar predicted.

For IT leaders, this means reconsidering vendor relationships and exploring service providers capable of delivering cross-platform management, security compliance, and lifecycle support – critical components to keep pace with evolving collaboration demands.

Navigating the Challenges Ahead

The road ahead is filled with difficult trade-offs.

Single-vendor platforms offer simplicity and streamlined security but risk limiting innovation and user choice. Conversely, multi-platform approaches maximize flexibility but increase complexity and cost.

Kar’s advice underscores the need for a holistic strategy:

“Hybrid work isn’t a passing phase. It is the new operating model. Success will depend not just on choosing the right platforms, but on how well those platforms work together, adapt to users, and scale with the business.”

Investing in integration, empowering users through self-service, and partnering with managed services providers that offer orchestration and AI-driven insights will be critical for enterprises to thrive in this hybrid era."
UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/collaboration/google-meets-automatic-room-check-in-with-ultrasound-detection-elevates-collaboration/,06-08-2025,Google Meet’s Automatic Room Check-In with Ultrasound Detection Elevates Collaboration,"Google Meet has potentially made hybrid meetings a little smarter and a lot smoother.

Its latest update introduces automatic room check-in via proximity detection. It uses ultrasonic signals to quietly sort out one of the most irritating aspects of modern collaboration: joining a meeting the right way, in the right room, without creating an echo chamber.

But beyond the tech’s slickness, there’s a deeper signal for enterprise IT, UC, and workplace leaders in that the age of context-aware collaboration is picking up speed.

A Smarter, Smoother Way to Join Meetings

Available now, Google Meet’s new automatic check-in feature uses proximity detection to do something deceptively clever. If you’re using Companion mode on your laptop within a meeting room equipped with certified Google Meet hardware, your device will now detect an ultrasonic signal from the room system and take the hint.

Before you even click “Join”, Google Meet highlights the Companion mode option, steering you away from audio feedback disasters and toward a cleaner, echo-free experience. Once you join, it automatically checks you into the correct room. If Dynamic Tiles are enabled, it may also prompt you to confirm your face via Face Match, so your name appears instead of the room’s.

This is a small but subtly significant improvement to the meeting join experience, one of those high-impact UX details that reduces friction at scale. The functionality is available only on Chrome via the Meet web app, and is currently limited to the green room (the interface before joining a call) and a brief period after Companion mode begins. Google recommends sticking with certified Meet hardware, as third-party devices may not deliver consistent results.

Admins get full control, of course. Proximity detection is enabled by default, but can be fine-tuned or switched off entirely on a per-device basis from the Admin console. That means organisations with stricter security, privacy, or device management policies can adapt the feature to their own needs.

Why the C-Suite and IT Leaders Should Take Note

On one level, this is a neat trick that reduces collaboration friction. But, viewed through a more ambitious lens, it also teases the future as a window into the next evolution of unified communications, one where platforms anticipate context, simplify choices, and actively prevent the kinds of mistakes that waste time and erode productivity.

This is good news for IT and UC teams. There will be fewer “how do I join this call?” helpdesk tickets and fewer moments of embarrassment as someone accidentally joins a meeting from their laptop and the room system simultaneously. This will likely result in fewer delays while someone figures out which button to press. It’s small stuff until you multiply it across hundreds of rooms and thousands of users every single day.

This illustrates a broader change for CIOs, CTOs, and workplace strategy leaders, moving away from reactive collaboration infrastructure to intelligent, proactive environments. Using sensors, audio cues, and automation, Google’s investment in context-aware UX is quietly transforming how people interact with tech in shared spaces. It’s intended to make the smart meeting room truly smart.

From a procurement angle, there’s something else going on here. By leaning into the benefits of a tightly integrated hardware-software ecosystem, Google is staking a claim in the enterprise UCaaS arms race. It’s not just about who has the best call quality or the most integrations anymore, but who can make the experience seamless, scalable, and invisible to the user.

That puts pressure on rivals. Organisations considering Microsoft Teams Rooms, Zoom Rooms, or Cisco devices now must ask: Can our meeting platform think for itself?

Google Meet’s Note Taker Gets an Update: How It Reduces the Need for Third-Party AI

In a quieter, but equally impactful, move, Google also supercharged its “Take Notes for Me” feature in Google Meet last month, making post-meeting intelligence more accessible and immediate.

Until now, users received a link to a Google Doc after their meeting wrapped up, requiring yet another click and context switch just to see what was discussed. With this latest update, Google is doing away with that extra step. The meeting summary and suggested next actions are now embedded directly in the recap email, resulting in no detours and no digging.

It’s a small change on the surface, but it tightens the feedback loop and keeps momentum flowing between meetings. For busy professionals juggling back-to-backs, this new embedded experience reduces friction and makes it easier to act on insights without interrupting their workflow.

Taken together with the new proximity-based check-in, Google Meet is becoming sharper, more helpful, and more seamlessly integrated into the rhythms of enterprise life."
UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/ccaas/ringcentral-and-att-join-to-expand-officehand-why-are-telcos-turning-to-ringcx/,05-08-2025,RingCentral and AT&T Join to Expand Office@Hand: Why Are Telcos Turning to RingCX?,"AT&T has announced the expansion of its Office@Hand unified communications platform through an extension of its 10-year partnership with RingCentral, incorporating RingCentral’s RingCX contact center technology.

This integration adds advanced AI-powered omnichannel contact center capabilities to AT&T’s existing UCaaS offerings. The enhanced Office@Hand service will be available to AT&T business customers across the US, aiming to improve customer interaction management and employee productivity through a single, cloud-based platform.

“By expanding our decade-long partnership with RingCentral, we are able to bring contact center and conversational intelligence functionality to our portfolio,”

Joe Petrocelli, VP of Communications Services, AT&T Business, said.

This announcement fits into a wider industry pattern where service providers are increasingly turning to RingCentral’s technology to underpin their own UC and CC solutions.

Digging into the Details of AT&T–RingCX

The expanded solution leverages AT&T’s extensive network infrastructure combined with RingCX’s cloud-native contact center platform, which supports voice, video, chat, SMS, and over 20 digital channels.

This allows businesses of all sizes to unify their communications and customer support functions while benefiting from AI-driven tools such as real-time transcription, sentiment analysis, and agent coaching.

This seamless integration allows businesses to manage customer interactions across voice, SMS, chat, and popular digital channels from one platform.

“By expanding Office@Hand Business Communication with RingCX Contact Center and RingSense AI functionalities, we’re delivering a unique platform, enhancing customer experiences, and empowering end-users to improve their core business,”

Homayoun Razavi, EVP & GM, Global Strategic Partnerships at RingCentral, said.

By adopting RingCX technology, AT&T is accelerating time-to-market and enriching its Office@Hand brand with advanced AI capabilities that are increasingly demanded in customer service environments.

But it’s not just AT&T that is seeing the utility. BT, one of the UK’s biggest telcos, also approached RingCentral to implement RingCX into its CCaaS offering.

RingCX Uncovered: Why Is It Cutting Through to Telcos?

Digging into BT’s arrangement with RingCentral, similarities begin to emerge as to why the platform is proving popular among telcos.

Both exemplify how these larger companies leverage RingCX to broaden their UC and CC offerings to their own customers without having to build solutions themselves from scratch.

“AT&T’s integration of RingCentral’s AI-powered contact center and conversational intelligence into Office@Hand delivers the comprehensive, AI-first customer experience platform enterprises are demanding,”

Dave Michels, principal analyst and founder of TalkingPointz, said.

“This partnership demonstrates how service providers can differentiate through AI while reducing customer complexity and costs—creating a compelling value proposition for organizations modernizing their customer engagement strategy.”

Like AT&T, RingCentral has a decade-long partnership with BT. This fact alone has helped give it a foot in the door, along with time to build partnerships and a solid understanding of the telco vertical and its needs.

Like with AT&T, its integrated contact center solution Cloud Work RingCX combines the elements of the telco’s strength—in this case BT’s network security and fraud management resources—with RingCX’s omnichannel and AI-driven capabilities.

For both telcos, the ability to incorporate AI is also a big draw of using RingCX to offer differentiated, AI-powered UC and CC services under their own brands.

This white-label or embedded technology approach allows these firms to innovate rapidly and deliver value-added features while reducing platform development risks and costs.

RingCX Dialing in to Telco Success

The strategic adoption of RingCX by multiple major telcos illustrates a broader shift in the UCaaS/CCaaS landscape toward platform-based partnerships and embedded technologies.

Companies want flexible, scalable, AI-powered solutions that they can confidently brand and deliver without building from scratch—a gap RingCX fills effectively.

Its long history with telcos and its own status as a telephony company means it was well positioned to serve these companies.

That, plus its investment in AI and conversational analytics, combined with its cloud-native, API-rich platform, has positioned it as a silent engine powering a growing number of service provider UC/CC offerings.

As the demand for seamless, omnichannel, and AI-augmented communication experiences continues to climb, the role of foundational platforms like RingCX will only grow. The question is no longer why companies turn to RingCX, but how quickly competitors will respond with comparable embedded technology strategies."
UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/ccaas/phase-two-for-ai-why-agent-augmentation-must-follow-automation-in-contact-centers-jabra/,04-08-2025,Phase Two for AI: Why Agent Augmentation Must Follow Automation in Contact Centers,"Contact centers, already no strangers to automation, have been some of the biggest wholesale adopters of the technology, with Gartner stating 85% of customer service leaders will explore or pilot customer-facing conversational AI in 2025.

Indeed, AI’s use in contact centers has already been seminal. AI chatbots are now able to reduce agent demand by dealing with routine customer queries that would have previously had to be handled by an agent. It’s a win for efficiency, but it’s not without ramifications. This change in inquiry handling has created a domino effect for agents.

“The nature of the calls that now come through a voice channel to human agents is much more complex,” Andreas Orebo Wenzel, VP of Engage AI at Jabra, said. “This has increased the demand on the calls and the agent.”

These incoming calls now often require deeper technical knowledge, emotional sensitivity, or decision-making finesse in order to satisfy customers.

But just as companies have invested heavily in AI to reduce human interaction, it’s now necessary to counterbalance this by deploying AI to assist the agents dealing with this new challenge.

Why AI Chatbots Make Human Jobs More Complex

With AI chatbots now solving more entry level issues, modern contact center agents are being asked to go more in-depth on each call to a weary customer who has already spent time trying to resolve their issue through the initial points of contact.

This creates a situation where they’re often expected to be the immediate solution to the issue, even if they’re just being introduced to the issue for the first time.

“Call center agents are expected to be able to handle tough questions right on the spot, even if they don’t know what the next call is about,” Orebo Wenzel emphasized.

On top of this cognitive pressure, agents often work in noisy or distracting environments — either from home or busy offices. This persistent background noise, even if subtle, contributes to fatigue.

“It can be very mentally draining,” Orebo Wenzel explained, “especially when you’re exposed to that through 6–8 hour shifts.”

But the challenges don’t stop there. Agents also have to juggle the associated administrative elements of the role — manual note-taking, CRM inputs, and multitasking — all while trying to sound composed and empathetic.

All these associated tasks and distractions make it increasingly difficult to efficiently resolve the customer’s reason for calling. This, in turn, could lead to unsatisfactory and slower resolutions — and an unhappy customer.

Recognizing this, audio specialists Jabra have augmented their solutions to bring AI to assist contact center agents so they can save agent capacity for focusing on what really matters: the customer.

How Jabra’s Engage AI Complete Turns the Tide

Engage AI Complete is a new premium tier of Jabra’s Engage AI software designed specifically for call centers. Its solution is tailored for the next chapter that contact center operations are entering.

Rather than replacing agents, it augments them with real-time support, data-driven coaching, and environmental optimization. First, it does this through two-way noise reduction. While Jabra’s headsets can cancel ambient noise on the agent’s side, Engage AI takes it further.

“With our technology, we can reduce background noise on the customer end of the call,” Orebo Wenzel said.

This ensures clarity even when customers call from chaotic environments, increasing comprehension for the agent and reducing the strain they experience in trying to understand muffled customers.

Second, it brings automated transcription and note summarization to agents. Using advanced speech-to-text, Engage AI transcribes calls live — freeing agents from manual note-taking and post-call data entry.

This doesn’t just boost productivity by allowing agents to take more calls — it helps them stay mentally and emotionally present when on the phone with customers.

“Instead of having to write down notes, you can leave that to the AI to do,” Orebo Wenzel explained.

Third — and perhaps most compelling — is its tone-of-voice analysis. Engage AI functions like a virtual mirror in the agent’s corner, using a simple red-amber-green visual cue to show whether they sound empathetic, flat, or engaged. It even analyzes both sides of the call, allowing agents to mirror the emotional tone of the caller in real time to engage with a customer on their terms. Although seemingly superficial, tone matters more than companies realize.

“You actually don’t remember what they said, but you very much remember how they made you feel,” Orebo Wenzel explained.

This solution becomes even more powerful when considering the offering it provides new hybrid work models many contact centers now operate under.

As supervisors can’t walk the floor the way they used to, Engage AI gives them contextual alerts about agent interactions when attention is needed. This allows contact center leaders to keep track of their team’s performance regardless of location, and coaching at scale without burning out supervisors or agents.

This implementation of AI at the agent level isn’t just an effort to reduce cognitive load — it’s a business case.

Jabra reports that when agents receive tone feedback and sound more engaged, calls become shorter and customer satisfaction rises.

“If I sound more engaged and friendly, then the likelihood of you perceiving that as a better customer experience is higher,” Orebo Wenzel said.

These shorter calls don’t just help agents — they mean better queue management, reduced costs, faster customer engagement time and improved first-call resolution.

The Future of Human-AI Collaboration Starts Here

As companies like Klarna have begun reversing AI-only strategies after seeing dips in customer satisfaction, it’s clear that an AI-only approach cannot deliver better outcomes for contact centers.

Thus, the next phase of AI in contact centers won’t be defined by how well machines replace humans, but by how intelligently they support them.

As customers bring more emotionally charged, complicated issues to live agents, it’s not enough to simply answer quickly. Agents need to listen deeply, respond empathetically, and solve problems fast — all while managing growing cognitive demands.

In this context, solutions like Engage AI Complete offer the ability to pursue that same desire for efficiency without sacrificing the customer experience.

In an industry where experience is everything and turnover is high, equipping agents with smart, assistive AI isn’t just a tech trend, it’s increasingly a competitive necessity."
UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/off-channel-messaging-how-to-stop-your-business-habit-becoming-a-hackers-heaven/,04-08-2025,Off-Channel Messaging: How to Stop Your Business Habit Becoming a Hacker’s Heaven,"Enterprise communication has changed dramatically over time. What began with emails since shifted to brief messages on platforms like Teams or Slack, and now again has changed so that much of it now takes place through employees’ personal instant messaging apps.

Whether it’s WhatsApp, iMessage, WeChat, Telegram, or SMS, employees are increasingly using consumer messaging apps to communicate with clients, partners, and even colleagues.

What began as a convenience during the early days of remote work, when each company was using different, and often incompatible UC software, has now become an entrenched part of daily workflows.

Although interoperability between platforms has improved, the seamless capability people get from using WhatsApp to message customers and clients means the practice persists.

However, by allowing staff to embrace this convenience, many businesses have unknowingly opened the door to serious security and compliance risks.

“Messaging has become a frontline communication tool,” says Ari Applbaum, VP of Marketing at LeapXpert. “But the underlying infrastructure, the tools, the governance, even user behavior, is still rooted in legacy channels like email. That creates a massive exposure gap.”

That gap is being exploited. The use of WhatsApp is increasingly attracting hackers who know that vital business information is passing through it. As a result, adversaries are using it as their preferred point of entry.

Once breached, businesses face data leaks, regulatory violations, and reputational damage, often with no way to protect themselves.

While most IT teams have built rigorous governance around email, very few have done the same for messaging. Attackers know this and are moving fast.

How Hackers Exploit the Messaging Gap

As messaging apps become business-critical tools, attackers target them as the path of least resistance. “Hackers have adapted quickly,” Applbaum explains. “They know businesses are messaging-first but security-second, that makes chat a soft target.”

Equally, these attacks are augmented by AI to use increasingly sophisticated phishing that can accurately impersonate clients. Indeed, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, impersonation scams have soared 148% year-on-year, thanks in part to AI tools.

Even small deviations in tone or punctuation can be AI-generated to mimic trusted senders. With WhatsApp messaging boasting a 98% open rate, and users treating chat messages with less scrutiny than email, phishing attempts are not only more believable but also sees increased engagement.

Once opened, a message might dupe the worker to clicking a link by claiming to be a client sharing a contract or a colleague requesting feedback on some work. Malware can then be loaded onto the worker’s phone, wreaking havoc.

This gives attackers access to all business-specific information discussed on that device: pricing, strategy, accounts, anything.

“Mobile device management secures the device,” says Applbaum, “but it doesn’t secure message content. That’s a common misconception.” He adds that end-to-end encryption is not a silver bullet: “Encrypted in transit doesn’t mean safe. You must consider where data is stored, how it’s processed, and who controls the keys.”

Companies have no way to detect or stop these breaches because business data on off-channel messaging isn’t connected to corporate systems. Personal cloud backups, auto-sync, and private storage mean sensitive data can live and leak from unmanaged environments.

The risks from such an occurrence range from compliance failures to breaches that threaten customer trust and regulatory rules.

Secure Messaging, Built for the Enterprise

You may think that one way of solving this challenge is to cease the use of off-channel messaging. Yet, that would prove futile and even a hindrance to valuable business being conducted on these channels.

But solving this requires more than adding security tools to existing apps; it demands rethinking messaging architecture.

LeapXpert offers a system that meets employees where they are while giving IT full control.

“Most tools were built for consumers and retrofitted for business,” Applbaum says.

“We flipped that. LeapXpert was built for enterprise-grade control and compliance first, introducing a single professional identity, one number across channels, within corporate governance.”

This approach eliminates what Applbaum calls “comms chaos.” Instead of requiring employees to juggle multiple apps, numbers, and accounts, LeapXpert allows them to use the same identity whilst using their preferred method of communications, be it WhatsApp, SMS, or iMessage. Equally, because it is under this single identity, this places all of these conversations happening across these channels firmly under the company’s enterprise communication umbrella.

Conversations are captured and governed centrally, giving organizations full visibility without disrupting user experience.

Equally, this overview companies get by unifying their communication channel enables real-time surveillance, metadata capture, and policy enforcement. Messages, even deleted or edited, are logged and archived per regulations, making compliance proactive.

Plus, this solution doesn’t just help govern your data but protect it, too. One of LeapXpert’s standout innovations, designed to detect this new AI threat in messaging, can be deployed as part of this unifying system.

Piloted with HSBC, this AI-powered impersonation detection engine analyzes how individuals typically communicate, down to word choice and punctuation, and flags deviations that could indicate fraud or spoofing.

Once you unify communications at the platform level, businesses no longer have to choose between productivity and security, they can have both.

Why Solving Messaging Security Can’t Wait

Off-channel messaging is not a cultural issue to be fixed, it’s a vulnerability waiting to be secured. Every message sent outside IT’s visibility increases the risk of a breach, a regulatory fine, or a public incident that can cost a company its reputation overnight.

As Applbaum emphasizes, protecting data is just one part of the equation. Organizations are also safeguarding customer relationships, brand equity, and trust.

Applbaum advises a clear risk assessment to address this: evaluate how employees communicate, where conversations are stored, and if channels meet regulatory standards. Then, move beyond reactive policies to secure-by-design platforms built on zero-trust, native APIs, and enterprise certifications.

Platforms must integrate with collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams to reduce friction, boost adoption, and maintain security without disrupting work. “If you want users to stick with a secure solution,” Applbaum says, “it has to fit how they already work.”

Finally, scrutinize technology partners for security posture, audit trails, and adaptability to new threats. Messaging isn’t going away. But the gap between communication and protection must close and fast.

Messaging isn’t going away, but the gap between communication and protection must close, and fast. Those who act now will avoid disaster, build resilience, and secure the competitive advantage that real-time messaging brings. Don’t let your business become a hacker’s heaven: take the first step towards secure, compliant communication today."
UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/scattered-spider-hackers-infiltrate-microsoft-teams-and-slack-what-it-teams-must-do-now/,04-08-2025,Scattered Spider Hackers Infiltrate Microsoft Teams and Slack: What IT Teams Must Do Now,"Security agencies have released a new advisory warning that the Scattered Spider hacking group is actively infiltrating collaboration platforms like Microsoft Teams and Slack.

According to the FBI and international cybersecurity partners, the group is using these channels to gather internal intelligence and launch highly targeted phishing attacks, combining ransomware with advanced social engineering tactics to compromise organisations.

“Per trusted third parties, Scattered Spider threat actors typically engage in data theft for extortion and also use several ransomware variants, most recently deploying DragonForce ransomware alongside their usual Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs),” the advisory stated.

While some TTPs remain consistent, Scattered Spider threat actors often change TTPs to remain undetected.”

For IT leaders, the message is clear: It’s time to tighten controls, rethink processes, and train staff to anticipate deception at every level.

Who Are Scattered Spider?

Researchers consider Scattered Spider unique within the cybercrime underground.

It consists largely of English-speaking young men (including many teenagers) from the US and the UK, and is estimated to have as many as 1,000 members.

The hacking group first made headlines in September 2023 with a ransomware attack on MGM Resorts that severely disrupted operations and cost the company over $100 million.

The group has also been linked to the 2023 Clorox cyberattack, which led to widespread product shortages and a $380 million lawsuit against Clorox’s IT vendor, Cognizant, for allegedly mishandling credentials.

Their earlier activities, dating back to 2021, included phishing campaigns targeting employee credentials, resulting in millions of dollars in theft and attacks on 45 companies.

Despite initial beliefs that the group had been dismantled, the group resurfaced in April 2025 with new attacks on major UK retailers Marks & Spencer, Harrods, and Co-op – causing an estimated £440 million in damages.

British authorities have since arrested four suspects and are analysing seized computer equipment for further leads.

What’s New – and Why IT Should Be on High Alert

Scattered Spider has added several new tools and tactics to its arsenal:

Impersonation 2.0: Hackers are no longer just pretending to be IT support – they’re posing as employees, tricking real IT staff into resetting passwords and transferring MFA tokens.

Collaboration Platform Infiltration: The group is actively infiltrating Microsoft Teams and Slack to gather internal intelligence, craft realistic phishing messages, and escalate privileges – all while blending in.

Critical Steps IT Teams Must Take Now

To defend against the evolving tactics of Scattered Spider, IT teams must take immediate, strategic action across multiple layers of their security infrastructure.

First, help desk protocols should be updated to include strict identity verification before resetting passwords or MFA tokens, along with call-back procedures for unusual requests and full logging of all credential-related interactions.

Multi-factor authentication must also be hardened – replacing SMS-based MFA with phishing-resistant options like hardware security keys or biometric methods, and enabling features such as number matching and geolocation prompts to prevent accidental approvals.

Remote access tools, which are frequently exploited by attackers, should be tightly controlled.

This means auditing all usage, restricting installation to approved applications, and setting up real-time alerts for tools like AnyDesk and TeamViewer.

In addition, internal communication platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Slack must be secured, with strong authentication requirements, restricted guest access, and ongoing monitoring for unusual behaviour – like messages from inactive accounts or logins from new locations.

Employees should also be trained to question unexpected requests, even when they appear to come from trusted internal sources.

Since Scattered Spider has shown a keen interest in platforms like Snowflake, organisations should enforce role-based access controls, enable detailed activity logging, and monitor for anomalies like unusually large query volumes, implementing rate limiting where necessary.

Finally, resilience against ransomware depends on strong recovery practices: IT teams should maintain encrypted, offline backups stored separately from production systems and conduct regular restoration drills to ensure they can bounce back quickly if an incident occurs.

Bottom Line: Assume You’re a Target

Scattered Spider isn’t just exploiting code – they’re exploiting people, habits, and trust.

Their techniques combine technical skill with psychological manipulation, targeting IT teams, help desks, and internal communication tools to gain a foothold.

In this landscape, technical defences alone are no longer enough. Organisations must embrace a zero-trust mindset, implement multi-layered access controls, and prioritize user training as a frontline defence strategy.

Every MFA prompt, every password reset request, and every Slack message is a potential attack vector.

The best defence is ultimately vigilance – built on clear processes, hardened systems, and a security-aware culture."

UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/microsoft-teams-gets-advanced-audit-logging-how-can-this-boost-your-meeting-security/,04-08-2025,Microsoft Teams Gets Advanced Audit Logging: How Can This Boost Your Meeting Security?,"Microsoft has quietly rolled out enhanced audit logging capabilities for Teams meetings in a bid to strengthen IT teams’ auditability and observability.

The update captures comprehensive data about who initiates screen shares, when control is requested or granted, and which participants access shared content during meetings.

This represents another step for Microsoft Teams to meetings more secure by offering granular visibility over sharing and recording meeting content.

Understanding the New Audit Logging Capabilities

Teams has a system of audit logs that help IT teams keep an overview of user and admin actions like messages sent, files shared, user logins, team creation, and changes to settings.

The new enhanced audit logging system now adds to this log by capturing a comprehensive range of meeting activities that were previously invisible to administrators.

For instance, when participants share screens during Teams meetings, the system now records detailed metadata including participant identities, timestamps for share initiation and termination, and specific details about control transfer actions.

Equally, this granular tracking extends to the use of “Take Control,” “Give Control,” and “Request Control” actions, providing a complete audit trail of who accessed what content, who initiated access, and when.

The new audit logs are accessible through Microsoft Purview or the Microsoft 365 compliance center, and make the logs searchable through familiar interfaces; administrators can filter logs using the “MeetingParticipantDetail” operation name or search for “screenShared” keywords to quickly identify relevant activities.

The system also supports date range filtering, enabling targeted investigations of specific time periods or incidents. Information from this portal can be exported as CSV files for further analysis.

Such a level of detail provides IT teams with unprecedented insight into how sensitive content flows through their organization’s virtual meetings.

This can not only help IT teams with auditability and compliance efforts by giving greater visibility into meetings but also aid in uncovering suspicious behavior that could be a sign of a security issue.

The Growing Threat Landscape

Microsoft’s recent update to Teams recognizes that the UC platform is increasingly being targeted, as hackers see it as a way to gain mission-critical information.

For instance, the Scattered Spider hacking group has been particularly active in exploiting Teams and similar collaboration platforms, using advanced social engineering techniques to manipulate employees and gain unauthorized access to corporate networks.

These attacks leverage the inherent trust users place in internal communication platforms, making them particularly dangerous and difficult to detect.

Once attackers establish a presence within Teams environments, they can gather intelligence about organizational structure, ongoing projects, and security practices.

Such tactics demonstrate that traditional security measures require reinforcement with more advanced monitoring and behavioral analytics.

Thus, the new capabilities to see who requested screen sharing can give additional clues to IT teams about users acting suspiciously and who need further investigation.

This particular focus on screen sharing seems to be of acute interest for Microsoft as they aim to make Teams more secure.

Last month, the company announced it is introducing a screen capture prevention feature, which will black out meeting windows when participants attempt to take screenshots.

Equally, participants joining a Teams call from unsupported platforms will be restricted to audio-only mode.

These technical controls further demonstrate that the tech titan sees its Teams meetings as a potential weak link for its customers.

Making Meetings More Secure

The introduction of advanced audit logging represents another incremental security improvement Microsoft is making to Teams and its meetings.

With these new audit tools, organizations can enhance their security posture by establishing baseline behavioral patterns for screen sharing and content access, enabling them to detect anomalies that might indicate security incidents or policy violations.

Equally, with Microsoft coincidentally rolling out remote diagnostic capabilities that gets logs from users’ devices, and an update that enables transcription policies by default for new tenants, this tool can work as part of a holistic approach to examining user behavior.

Such intelligence can inform targeted training programs and policy adjustments to reduce security risks.

Equally, such capabilities can prove particularly valuable for industries with strict compliance requirements, extending their level of auditability essential for regulatory compliance."

UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/uniti-seals-13-4bn-windstream-merger-what-the-deal-means-for-it-and-c-suite-leaders/,04-08-2025,Uniti Seals $13.4Bn Windstream Merger: What the Deal Means for IT and C-Suite Leaders,"Uniti has officially swallowed Windstream, potentially moving the telecoms dial.

As of August 4, 2025, the two companies, once entangled exes after Uniti’s 2015 spin-off from Windstream, are now back under one roof, this time with Uniti calling the shots following a deal worth a reported $13.4 billion.

On paper, the deal makes sense. Uniti and Windstream have been codependent for years, sharing infrastructure, disputes, and lawyers. Now, the merger draws a firmer line under their shared past.

The merger, finalised this past week, sees both Windstream and “Legacy Uniti” become wholly owned subsidiaries of the new Uniti Group. Shareholders of the old Uniti received a conversion ratio of 0.6029 shares in the new entity, giving them a 62 percent controlling stake in the combined company. Convertible notes have been recalibrated, too, reflecting the updated equity structure.

Next on the agenda: debt consolidation. Uniti plans to fold all existing liabilities, both its own and Windstream’s, into a single organisational silo, which should offer them financial clarity, operational simplicity, and investor confidence.

However, beneath the corporate headlines lies a deeper undercurrent, and tech buyers can’t afford to ignore it.

Why This Matters to Tech Leaders, and What to Do About It

For CIOs, CTOs, IT directors, UC leads, and procurement teams, wariness and caution around this merger are understandable.

When major telecom players merge, disruption tends to be a probability rather than a possibility. SLAs often get rewritten, support teams might get restructured, and account managers are sometimes reshuffled. Pricing models might be retooled. In the thick of it, the organisations that are the telecoms’ customers often find themselves confronting a suddenly unfamiliar scenario.

This might not necessarily happen following the Uniti/Windstream merger. The process could be seamless and harmonious, even result in a refined customer experience and product delivery. However, due diligence and proactive strategic planning never hurt anyone.

If your organisation uses Uniti or Windstream, directly or via a third-party provider, it might be advisable to get ahead of this. Now, reach out to your reps and ask the awkward questions. What changes are coming to service delivery? Are support processes shifting? Will your contracts be honoured or reinterpreted?

Even if the answer is “no change”, don’t necessarily take it at face value. Mergers often create a vacuum of clarity in the short term, even if the long-term vision is rosy. IT and UC leaders should pressure-test their infrastructure. Do you have redundancy? Can you pivot if needed? Is your vendor risk strategy genuinely robust or fallible and outdated?

Diversification, due diligence, and contractual agility are strategic imperatives. This is arguably the moment to interrogate your supplier stack, re-evaluate risk, and refine a contingency plan that doesn’t hinge on crossed fingers and legacy SLAs.

Final Takeaway

The Uniti-Windstream merger is a salient reminder that the infrastructure underpinning your business is in a constant state of flux. You’re gambling with continuity if you’re not actively managing that reality.

For IT, C-Suite, and UC leaders with skin in the game, this is your cue to review, reassess, and realign. When the telecom giants move, the aftershocks often hit everyone."
UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/market-guide-category/enabling-industry-specific-compliance-for-enterprise-comms/,01-08-2025,Enabling Industry-Specific Compliance for Enterprise Comms,"In an ideal world, managing communications compliance would be simple. Every company would follow the same rulebook, use the same tools, and mitigate the same threats. In the real world, the idea that a single security strategy can fit every industry is collapsing fast.

Companies can’t just build ecosystems that adapt to new threats like AI deepfakes and advanced spoofing mechanisms anymore. They need industry-specific compliance solutions tailored to their workflows. Sure, different companies might face similar threats, but the way they handle those hurdles needs to be more focused. Healthcare, finance, education, and government groups all have different rules to follow.

HIPAA means encrypted video and patient logs, not just generic TLS. Finance requires immutable archives for SEC and FINRA; “record soft delete” isn’t acceptable. Schools must deal with FERPA and COPPA, adding requirements like parental consent for underage users.

One-size-fits-all platforms can’t always handle that complexity. Many companies now need something more fine-tuned, modular, context-aware architecture, like the systems powered by Netsapiens’ multi-tenant hosted PBX platform for service providers.

Here’s why a solution layered with industry-specific controls is so valuable in today’s world.

The Rise of Multi-Tenant, Flexible Architecture

When most people hear “multi-tenant,” they picture a single infrastructure hosting many customers. It’s great for sharing costs, speeding deployment, and scaling rapidly. In fact, multi-tenant strategies are so popular that some studies show that up to 94 percent of enterprise customers rely on them.

But sharing services also means sharing risks and limitations, if the architecture in question isn’t capable of being fine-tuned to the needs of each individual business. True multi-tenant systems require airtight data separation, strict access controls, and flexible resource policies for industry-specific compliance and continued uptime.

A multi-compliant system doesn’t just separate customers, it adapts to their rules. Health providers need encrypted video and audit logs. Financial teams must archive calls immutably. Schools managing student data must enforce parental consent and retention rules.

With solutions like Netsapien’s hosted PBX solution, you can run a common cloud foundation with centralized efficiency. On top of that, you plug in compliance modules tailored to each sector’s demands.

The Importance of Industry-Specific Compliance Architecture

Compliance doesn’t look the same for everyone. Healthcare, finance, education, and legal teams aren’t dealing with the same threats or regulations. Their needs are wildly different, right down to how they store call logs or who gets access to chat transcripts.

Every Industry Has Its Own Rulebook

In healthcare, HIPAA requires full encryption for all levels of conversations, strict audit trails, and signed Business Associate Agreements with vendors. Providers need to know exactly who accessed what and when. A misplaced access log could lead to investigations or fines that hit seven figures.

Finance has its own rules. FINRA and SEC demand recorded conversations stored immutably, often for years. Those recordings need to be instantly retrievable and legally defensible. You can’t afford a missed call or a broken audit trail.

Schools have to follow FERPA and COPPA. That means protecting student data, enforcing parental consent, and sometimes applying stricter controls based on age groups. One-size-fits-all security won’t get you there. Organizations need a way to apply the right protections to the right people at the right time.

It’s not just about the tools, either; it’s about the context. You can have great encryption, robust access controls, and reliable logging. But if a receptionist has the same access as a clinician in a hospital, or a junior analyst in a bank can delete archived calls, then your system’s not compliant. Context matters.

A multi-compliant platform lets you build policies around the actual work people are doing, not just the system they’re using. For service providers, this isn’t just a risk management issue. It’s a business strategy. Being able to offer HIPAA-ready services or FINRA-compliant contact centers makes you more valuable to regulated industries. You open up new verticals and win deals your competitors can’t even bid on.

A Platform Built for Industry-Specific Compliance

Netsapiens has taken a measured approach to solving compliance problems, offering service providers a hosted multi-tenant solution that can adapt to thousands of different client needs. A healthcare provider can access specific controls for HIPAA-compliant conversations, while a finance leader can bake in call recording with session encryption and access logs.

According to one service provider (DiRad), NetSapien’s architecture has helped them become a major contact center player in the healthcare industry, one of the most regulated and complex sectors in the world.

The system supports fine-grained isolation, so each tenant gets their own compliance profile. Role-based access control, audit logging, and encryption are all included and ready to customize to suit each client’s needs. The result is flexibility without fragmentation.

Updates and patches roll out platform-wide, but compliance features can be toggled on a per-tenant basis. If one client requires additional privacy controls, they get them. If another doesn’t need those features, they don’t pay for what they don’t use.

Netsapiens even uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to deliver advanced analytics, automated disaster recovery, zero-trust capabilities, DDoS prevention, and real-time threat detection. It’s an end-to-end approach to making communications not just more reliable but safer, too.

How the Architecture Delivers Industry-Specific Compliance

Netsapien’s approach to optimizing the future of communications goes beyond focusing on features. It’s the architecture that really makes the difference. A flexible, multi-tenant core gives service providers a shared foundation for scalable voice, messaging, video infrastructure, global updates, and unified monitoring. In addition, each tenant gets a compliance profile tailored to their industry.

Features include:

Logical Separation : Tenants stay separate at the data layer, isolated databases or schemas ensure one tenant’s data never leaks into another’s environment. Policies apply to each tenant independently. Updates happen once, but they respect every client’s settings.

: Tenants stay separate at the data layer, isolated databases or schemas ensure one tenant’s data never leaks into another’s environment. Policies apply to each tenant independently. Updates happen once, but they respect every client’s settings. Role-Based Access Controls : This means policies say who can initiate a video call, who can view it, and who can delete it. In healthcare, nurses get different permissions than physicians. In finance, only compliance officers can download recorded calls.

In finance, only compliance officers can download recorded calls. Encryption and Key Management : Every tenant gets data encrypted in transit and at rest. But the keys? Those can be tenant-specific, rotating on schedule and managed separately. Providers aren’t left holding master keys; they’re using a secure, policy-driven key lifecycle.

Providers aren’t left holding master keys; they’re using a secure, policy-driven key lifecycle. Compliance Logs and Auditing : Every access, call, session, or download is logged along with timestamps, user IDs, and device IPs. If an auditor comes knocking, providers can pull tailored log reports by tenant or timeframe without combing through a merged data dump.

: Every access, call, session, or download is logged along with timestamps, user IDs, and device IPs. If an auditor comes knocking, providers can pull tailored log reports by tenant or timeframe without combing through a merged data dump. Demand Compliance Workflows: Rather than customizing per tenant manually, administrators use a UI to flip on modules. This activates video encryption, call monitoring, retention policies, etc. Updates, like new regulations, roll out platform-wide. Tenants receive any new compliance features automatically based on their profile.

Bringing all this together means providers don’t build separate stacks for each regulation. They maintain one stable, efficient foundation that scales control and trust across industries.

Compliance as a Growth Strategy

Creating a platform tuned to the needs of industry-specific compliance is a great way to help businesses avoid penalties. It’s also a direct route to winning better business for service providers.

Multi-tenant UCaaS systems drive clear ROI with lower infrastructure costs, predictability, and streamlined operations. These modern UCaaS setups can boost productivity, reduce shadow IT, and centralize governance, leading to measurable gains in both time and money saved.

In addition, providers who offer HIPAA-grade or FINRA-ready services tap into premium markets. They can pitch to healthcare groups, financial advisors, legal firms, or schools, clients who expect compliance out of the box. They’re not just offering chat or video; they’re offering security that meets regulatory demands. That’s a far stronger play than competing only on features or price.

Operationally, delivering compliance per tenant avoids expensive, entirely separate environments. You enable policies only where they’re needed, avoid over-engineering, and roll out updates globally. Meanwhile, clients benefit from faster onboarding. Netsapiens partners have reported significantly shorter setup times when compliance features are part of the platform by default.

Future Trends: AI, Confidential Computing, and Beyond

Designing multi-compliant systems isn’t easy. You’re dealing with shared infrastructure, evolving laws, and higher stakes. Data leakage, tenant misconfiguration, and outdated encryption can compromise your platform.

At the same time, compliance demands keep evolving, and vendors are paying more attention to cutting-edge tech ready to enhance industry-specific compliance. AI-driven anomaly detection is already helping providers flag suspicious access or behavior in real time. Soon, confidential computing, hardware-based secure enclaves, will let systems process sensitive data without exposure.

Expect more granular data sovereignty tools, too, auto-assigning workloads to data centers based on regulation or masking sensitive fields dynamically depending on user roles. Platforms will need to bootstrap contextual workflows, such as parental consent in education, consent tracking for telehealth sessions, or dynamic call archiving for financial services.

At the end of the day, the next-generation compliance model isn’t reactive. It learns, adapts, and applies controls only where needed, to balance usability, security, and legal responsibility.

A New Era of Industry-Specific Communication Compliance

For service providers, building platforms that adapt to the regulatory realities of different industries is quickly becoming the new baseline. Whether it’s encrypted video calls for clinicians, long-term call archiving for wealth advisors, or student data protections for schools, compliance has to be built into the architecture, not bolted on later.

Netsapiens shows what this looks like in practice. A single, multi-tenant foundation that scales efficiently, layered with compliance modules that activate only when needed. It’s smart, flexible, and future-ready. Just as important, it allows service providers to move faster, onboard regulated clients with less friction, and stay ahead of shifting legal expectations.

For anyone designing or deploying communication platforms today, the next era isn’t just multi-tenant, it’s multi-compliant, industry-specific, and customizable. Anything else will simply crumble as regulations continue to evolve."
UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/revolutionizing-retail-choosing-the-best-communications-platform-for-seamless-commerce/,01-08-2025,Revolutionizing Retail: Choosing the Best Communications Platform for Seamless Commerce,"Retail doesn’t wait. It doesn’t slow down for missed calls, dropped video links, or disconnected store teams. Whether you’re running 30 stores or 3,000, your frontline workers, HQ staff, logistics partners, and customer service agents all need to be on the same page, often quite literally.

In 2025, that means investing in a unified communications and collaboration platform that authentically connects your workforce, flexes around your tech stack, and helps you move fast without breaking things.

The problem is that most platforms weren’t built with retail in mind. They were made for offices, not aisles. That’s why IT and tech leaders in retail need to look beyond buzzwords and focus on what actually works for their business: mobility, integrations, speed, scale, and a platform that understands the organised chaos of retail operations.

Here’s what’s broken in retail communication today, and suggestions for how to fix it.

The Communication Headaches Retail Can’t Afford

Arguably, most retail communication setups are a mess. HQ uses Microsoft Teams, stores rely on group chats or personal mobiles, and customer service runs on a contact centre that barely talks to anything else. The result is often disconnected teams, duplicated work, missed opportunities, and managers scrambling to pull information from five different systems.

Add in high staff turnover, perpetually shifting rotas, supply chain glitches, and pressure to deliver standout customer experiences, and suddenly, reliable comms are absolutely essential.

Facilities and HR teams struggle to roll out consistent training and updates, IT is stretched trying to keep everything patched and connected, and execs want real-time data from every corner of the operation. It’s no wonder more retailers are ditching fragmented tools for UC platforms that bring voice, video, messaging, and collaboration into one place.

What Retailers Should Really Look for in a UC&C Platform

Forget the fluff. Retailers need platforms that are:

Mobile-first and store-ready. Your people aren’t sitting at desks; they’re on the floor, in the backroom, or on the move. The platform needs to work seamlessly across devices, even on flaky Wi-Fi.

AI-smart, not AI-hype. You don’t need AI that generates poems. You need AI that routes calls smartly, writes summaries, flags issues, and helps your teams move faster.

Plug-and-play with your stack. Whether it’s POS systems, ERP, inventory tools, or Salesforce, your UC platform has to speak the same language. Otherwise, you’re just building another silo.

Compliant and secure. Retail handles a lot of sensitive data, such as payment info, customer profiles, and staff records. If your platform doesn’t have baked-in compliance, it’s a liability.

Simple to scale. You don’t want a 12-month rollout across regions, but a system that works across 1 site or 1,000, with admin controls that don’t require a PhD.

Now, let’s get into the contenders.

Microsoft Teams: The Corporate Backbone (But With Retail Grit?)

If you’re already deep in the Microsoft ecosystem, Teams feels like a natural choice. It ties neatly into Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, Excel; the whole M365 gang. You get chat, calls, meetings, file-sharing, task management, and some solid security under the hood.

Teams excels at internal collaboration, particularly. It’s great for head office, finance, HR, and training. You can spin up Teams channels for different stores or departments, drop in files, run live video training, and keep everything archived and auditable.

The downside might be that it’s a bit corporate. If your store staff aren’t used to it, onboarding can feel heavy. Meanwhile, Microsoft has improved its webinars and external meeting features, but it’s still a step behind Zoom in terms of external-facing capabilities.

Good for: Retailers already using Microsoft 365, or with large HQ teams needing structured workflows.

Watch out for: Extra costs if you also need Zoom, and a steeper learning curve for non-desk workers.

Zoom Workplace: The People’s Favourite, Now With More Muscle

Zoom used to be the video call app. Now, it’s a full UC platform, Zoom Workplace, which combines meetings, chat, whiteboard, phone, and AI tools. It’s slick, lightweight, and ridiculously easy to use.

For retailers, Zoom hits the sweet spot when it comes to training, vendor collaboration, or cross-store meetings. The interface is clean, mobile-friendly, and familiar even to new hires. Zoom’s AI tools, like meeting summaries and smart recordings, cut admin time. If you need to bring in partners, franchisees, or external vendors, it’s hard to beat.

That said, integration with legacy systems or complex workflows isn’t as deep as Microsoft or RingCentral. Also, if you’re also using Teams for internal stuff, running both adds up.

Good for: Retailers who prioritise ease-of-use, training, and smooth external communications.

Watch out for: Integration gaps and potential platform overlap if you’re already tied to Microsoft.

RingCentral: Built for Call-Heavy, Always-On Retail Ops

RingCentral takes voice seriously. It’s built for organisations where the phone still rules: contact centres, support teams, and store-to-HQ comms. But it also includes messaging, video, task tools and a powerful mobile app.

Retailers with centralised support hubs or distributed customer service teams will appreciate its deep call routing, voicemail-to-text, analytics, and AI-powered assistant tools. It integrates well with Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, and other key enterprise apps. Additionally, it’s built for scale. If you’re opening new sites, it grows with you.

It has a bit more of an “old-school enterprise” feel, which can be a plus or minus depending on your culture. The interface isn’t as friendly as Zoom’s, but the backend is rock solid.

Good for: Retailers who run large contact centres or prioritise high-volume voice and customer interactions.

Watch out for: A slightly clunky interface and pricing complexity depending on features.

Cisco Webex: Enterprise Power, If You’ve Got the Muscle

Cisco Webex has been doing this for decades, and it shows. Its infrastructure is secure, reliable, and compliant across global regions. It comes with advanced calling, messaging, meeting, and contact centre tools, plus excellent in-room hardware support if you’re building next-gen collaboration spaces at HQ or in flagship stores.

It’s a strong option for larger or global retailers that need strict compliance and performance guarantees. However, it does come with a learning curve, and it’s not always intuitive for store staff.

Good for: Global or security-conscious retailers needing bulletproof infrastructure.

Watch out for: Complexity and heavier deployment requirements.

Mitel: The Quiet Contender for Hybrid Environments

Mitel often flies under the radar, but it’s got some serious strengths, especially for retailers with legacy phone systems or hybrid environments. It supports on-prem, cloud, or hybrid setups, integrates with Teams, and doesn’t force you to rip and replace.

It’s less flashy than Zoom or Teams, but it does the job well, particularly for voice-centric operations that want a phased move to the cloud. The interface feels a bit dated in places and lacks some of the newer AI tools, but for certain retailers, that’s a fair trade-off for flexibility.

Good for: Retailers with existing Mitel infrastructure or hybrid comms environments.

Watch out for: Less modern UI and fewer native integrations.

The Bottom Line

Retailers categorically need a platform that can handle the realities of the shop floor, the boardroom, and the call centre without missing a beat. In 2025, the best UC&C solution is the one that brings your people, your tech stack, and your customers together in real time.

Go with Microsoft Teams if you’re all-in on M365 and need a structured, secure environment.

Choose Zoom if you want ease, adoption speed, and standout external meeting experiences.

Pick RingCentral if voice is your lifeline and contact centres are core to your business.

Lean toward Webex if you want a fortress of compliance and enterprise reliability.

Look at Mitel if you’re transitioning from legacy systems and want a flexible migration path.

Just don’t settle for a platform that doesn’t get retail. Because in this industry, the difference between “out of stock” and “sold out” often comes down to how fast your teams can communicate."
UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/reviews/collaboration_reviews/team-collaboration-reviews/what-is-zoom-tasks-and-what-can-it-do-for-enterprises/,01-08-2025,What is Zoom Tasks and What Can it Do for Enterprises?,"What is Zoom Tasks, and what can it really do for businesses? Well, first of all, it’s not your traditional “task management” tool. Zoom Tasks is one of the newest components of Zoom’s agentic AI roadmap – designed to prove the company is about more than just video conferencing.

It was introduced in March 2025 as part of a major update to both Zoom Workplace, and Zoom AI Companion – the built-in AI assistant, similar to Microsoft Copilot. This tool can automatically identify action items from a meeting, assign “to-do” actions to specific team members, and even help each employee complete projects throughout the day.

It’s really an extension of Zoom’s AI assistant, which makes it a more proactive digital colleague capable of aligning teams, consolidating information, and streamlining review and approval.

Here’s what you need to know.

What is Zoom Tasks? A New Agentic Experience

Zoom Tasks is an AI-powered task management solution powered by AI Companion and integrated into Zoom Workplace. Unlike your standard “task management app”, it doesn’t just give you a central place where you can track and manage to-do lists.

With Zoom Tasks, every team gets an intelligent assistant committed to maintaining project momentum. This assistant listens in during meetings, making notes when someone requests a report or mentions a problem. It then drafts action items and issues them to specific team members in a dedicated section of Zoom Workplace.

Users can review these tasks, add them to their to-do list, and then get immediate suggestions for how to complete a task from AI Companion by clicking on an icon. Zoom created this agentic AI task management tool to address the challenges companies usually face with distributed teams.

For instance, a third of leaders spend more than an hour just following up with teammates to check on the status of a project (costing around $16,000 per year in inefficiencies). Then you’ve got the issue of tracking everything that’s mentioned in a meeting to contend with, too.

Zoom Tasks centralizes task information, smart suggestions, and workflow automation into one environment, saving everyone time and effort.

So, what does Zoom Tasks actually do for enterprise teams? Zoom says it’s here to make managing workflows easier. If you’re struggling to keep track of endless notes and to-do items from back-to-back meetings, you can switch on Zoom Tasks, and it’ll consolidate everything into your handy “Tasks” tab. When you need to provide team leaders with status updates, AI Companion can use your task info to draft those messages for you.

When you’re absolutely overwhelmed by a pile of work, you can head into Zoom Tasks and get AI Companion to help you out with hints on where to start, or ask it to do things for you, like compile research, write the first draft of an email, or schedule a meeting.

How Teams Can Use Zoom Tasks

Here’s an idea of how that kind of functionality might translate into workflows across the enterprise.

Sales: For Sales teams, Zoom Tasks can gather information during a discovery call and assign tasks like “Send a follow-up” emails to specific employees. It can even connect with CRM platforms to make it easier to log notes and track pipeline status.

HR Teams: For companies using Zoom for hiring, onboarding, and even everyday HR processes, Zoom Tasks makes it easy to track each action item, from reviewing resumes to scheduling onboarding lunches and tracking time off requests.

Basically, Zoom Tasks can benefit any team that needs to keep track of complicated to-do lists and get help with projects along the way.

What is Zoom Tasks? How it Compares to Traditional Tools

At a glance, it might look like Zoom Tasks is just another to-do list generator (with a little AI baked in). Plenty of task and project management tools offer AI features today. But there are a few things that make Zoom Tasks stand out.

First, this tool lives inside your day-to-day workflows, with built-in meeting and chat integration, so teams can work on projects collaboratively, without jumping between tools.

You’re not manually transferring notes to a task board. Zoom’s AI is listening, parsing, and acting the moment the words leave your mouth (or keyboard).

It also proactively takes action on your behalf. Once admins enable this tool, they can ask it to assign tasks to teams, monitor progress, and generate status reports automatically in the background, without having to do extra work.

It also comes included with approved Workplace plans, so you’re not paying extra for another AI tool, like ChatGPT.

Getting Started with Zoom Tasks

Zoom Tasks (with AI Companion) comes built into eligible Zoom Workplace plans (the free plan doesn’t include this feature). If you’re on the right paid plan already, make sure your Zoom Workplace is up-to-date (version 6.4.3). After that, you’ll need to switch the feature on.

Go to your online account settings, click the AI Companion tab, then scroll down until you see “Tasks”. Enable the option to have AI Companion manage and create tasks for you. You can also allow the bot to generate tasks from meeting transcripts.

Once the feature is enabled, you can view your Tasks from an icon in the top navigation bar of Zoom Workplace. If you can’t see it, click the “More” button.

Quick tips:

Check your Recommended Tasks list at the end of each day to see anything that’s been assigned to you. You can click Accept to add those tasks to your list.

within any task you’re reviewing. Right-click on tasks that appear in your Zoom chat or email threads to manually add them to your Task list.

Click View Details on any assigned tasks for more information about what you need to do, or insights from meetings.

One other note – if you’re not using AI Companion, you can still use Zoom Tasks for basic task management. You’ll just need to manually create, assign, and manage your own to-do list.

What is Zoom Tasks? The Future of Productivity

Zoom Tasks with AI Companion is just one highlight in a series of agentic-AI-enhanced updates rolling out to Zoom Workplace. Already, Zoom is experimenting with custom workflow options within the AI Companion studio. There are also options to connect Zoom Tasks to third-party apps.

Going forward, expect even more advanced agentic AI solutions from Zoom. That might include a companion that creates, assigns, and updates tasks, adjusts them as priorities change, alerts you before a deadline slips away, and suggests options when a task is “blocked”.

With solutions like Zoom Tasks and AI Companion, Zoom isn’t just helping you to organize your to-do list. It’s giving you a more intuitive way to orchestrate your entire workday."

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/new-appointments/four-key-hires-bolster-access4-uk-team,06-08-2025,Four key hires strengthen Access4 UK team,"Access4 UK has expanded its team as part of the company’s growth journey with the strategic addition of new staff, and it has ambitious plans for further development over the next 12 months.

Following the successful acquisition of Luminate Wholesale in April 2025, the company is now doubling down on its investment in the region, welcoming four new team members and preparing for further expansion to meet rising demand from MSPs and resellers.

The newly appointed team members bring combined expertise across partner acquisition, technical consultancy, and marketing.

The team coming on board include Philip Lee, Partner Acquisition Manager, a seasoned channel professional with a track record in building strategic partnerships; Paul Cooke, Partner Acquisition Manager, who brings telecoms expertise and a passion for helping partners unlock new revenue streams; and Nathalie Collins, Solutions Consultant, who has technical experience and will focus on enabling partners with tailored UCaaS and CCaaS solutions.

Finally, Emily Targett, Marketing Manager, will join to help drive brand awareness and partner engagement across the UK market.

This expansion sees the UK team nearly double in size, underscoring Access4’s rapid growth and increasing investment in the region.

Over the next 12 months, Access4 UK plans to further scale its operations with additional hires across sales, support, and technical enablement, giving partners greater support and faster onboarding as they transition to cloud-based communications.

Jonathan Walker, CEO UK at Access4 commented: “Welcoming our new team to the Access4 UK family, their combined experience and energy are already making a tangible impact as we scale our partner programme and deliver more value to MSPs and resellers across the region.”"
Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/3g/virgin-media-o2-continues-3g-mobile-switch,06-08-2025,Virgin Media O2 continues 3G mobile switch-off,"Virgin Media O2 will be switching off its 3G network in Watford on 17th September as part of the company’s plans to deliver faster and more reliable 4G and 5G connectivity for mobile customers, following successful completed switch-offs in Durham, Norwich, Telford, Guildford and Torquay.

The process will help boost the availability of mobile radio spectrum to more efficient 4G and 5G services to further improve the coverage and mobile broadband speeds of their modern networks.

It will also help customers’ experience with faster data speeds, more reliable streaming and higher quality voice calls.

The company’s 3G network which first launched more than 20 years ago today carries less than 2% of all network data – a figure which continues to fall.

The switch-off of this older technology – agreed by the Government and all mobile network operators in 2021 – allows providers like Virgin Media O2 to reallocate mobile spectrum to more efficient 4G and 5G services.

It means that customers in Watford will require at least a 4G SIM and handset to continue using mobile data once 3G is switched off.

Customers who don’t upgrade to a 4G or 5G device before 3G is switched off will still be able to use voice calls and send text messages as they currently do for now, but they would not be able to use mobile data.

Virgin Media O2 has upgraded 4G and 5G masts in Watford over the past year, and the company invests around £2m daily into its mobile network to meet growing demand for connectivity.

Customers of virtual network operators that use Virgin Media O2’s mobile network – such as Tesco Mobile and giffgaff – will also be impacted by the switch-off and are being contacted directly by their provider.

Jeanie York, Virgin Media O2’s Chief Technology Officer (pictured) said: “Switching off our 3G network will enable us to focus our investment on upgrading faster, more reliable and more energy-efficient 4G and 5G networks, giving our customers a better overall experience.

“Following on from successful switch-offs in other areas, we’re now turning our attention to Watford, which will have 3G withdrawn on 17th September.”"

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/online-safety/guest-metrics-rolls-out-online-safety-tools-protect-children,05-08-2025,Guest Metrics rolls out online safety tools to protect children,"Guest Metrics is helping public venues across the UK stay compliant with the Online Safety Act by delivering filtered, age-assured, and audit-ready public WiFi using a new platform that helps protect children from harmful digital content.

Founded by telecoms veteran Jonny Robinson, the company is launching a nationwide rollout to help venues bring their public WiFi into compliance, boosting much-needed protection for children and young people, as the Online Safety Act introduces new legal obligations for digital safety in public spaces.

Designed specifically for hospitality venues, local authorities, libraries, stadiums, and any space offering internet access to children, Guest Metrics provides key tools that will ensure children are kept safe.

These include templated children’s risk assessments; Child Safe content filtering; privacy-first facial age estimation (no ID upload or biometric storage); and session-level logging aligned with Ofcom’s Protection of Children Code.

Robinson (pictured) commented: “The question that we’re putting to every UK venue is: “Would you know if your public WiFi is harming children?”

“Too many venues still offer open, unfiltered WiFi — which can expose children to harmful content or be exploited by abusers. The law has changed. Our job is to make compliance painless.”

From July 2025, the law changed and venues must respond accordingly. This means that any venue offering public WiFi to children must block access to illegal or age-inappropriate material; complete a children’s online risk assessment; follow Ofcom’s Protection of Children Code of Practice; and be able to produce records proving compliance.

Failure to act could result in regulatory enforcement, fines up to £18m, and reputational damage — even for small businesses or councils unaware of the changes.

Guest Metrics is designed for adoption by venue operators, IT resellers, and telecoms service providers, and gives full support for multi-tenant environments.

Robinson concluded: “As someone who’s worked in telecoms for over a decade, I’ve seen the gaps in public access networks — especially when it comes to safety and accountability.

“With Guest Metrics, we’ve built something that makes WiFi access safer for children and simpler for venue owners. Compliance doesn’t have to be complicated — but inaction now carries real risk.”"

It also shows that Zyxel is working to align its decarbonisation pathway with the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement.

Zyxel’s validated near-term targets include reducing absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 42 percent by 2030 from a 2021 base year; and reducing absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 58.8 percent by 2034 from a 2023 base year.

The deal marks the start of a “significant” partnership and helps put in place steps to implement the county council’s vision of using new technology to transform its services and better support its residents.

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/sponsored-content/ai-hype-why-noise-slowing-sales,05-08-2025,AI Hype: Why the Noise is Slowing Sales,"We are deep in the AI hype cycle. Generative AI, LLMs, Agentic AI - buzzwords dominate the headlines. Gartner defines this cycle as the journey from inflated expectations to disillusionment before reaching meaningful, practical use. That’s where we are now.

But let’s not forget, AI isn’t new. IBM Watson made headlines as far back as 2004 and famously won Jeopardy! in 2011. The novelty isn’t the tech; it’s the marketing surge and the avalanche of claims that AI will replace call centers, SDRs, and more. Maybe it will - eventually. But right now, all the hype is backfiring, especially when it comes to selling.

Here are the three big reasons why:

1. Buyers Are Confused

Surveys are divided: some say AI boosts productivity; others call it delusional. Many businesses are caught in the middle, unsure of what’s real. In any tech adoption curve, most customers are not early adopters. They’re risk-averse and wary of change. Selling cloud services is already hard, you’re asking a business to abandon a system they’ve used for years. Selling AI? Even harder. It’s change on steroids.

2. FOMO Leads to Paralysis

Becomes the Future PBX dealers once dominated business telecom. They sold, installed, trained, and maintained systems. When UCaaS emerged, many assumed they were obsolete. Wrong. Turns out, the skill set didn’t die—it evolved. Businesses still want hands-on implementation, training, MACD, and Tier 1 support. The PBX dealers who realized this pivoted and are now charging multiples over the $13-per-seat nonsense.

3. AI Still Requires Strategy and Structure

The idea of a magical AI agent answering every customer question sounds great, until you realize it needs structure, data, and a solid plan. Anyone who’s ever built a website, an IVR system, or a reporting dashboard knows it’s not plug-and-play. AI is no different. Strategy, architecture, and accessible data are prerequisites, and most small businesses aren’t ready.

In fact, many don’t even have usable data. Even larger enterprises are stuck with siloed or unstructured data that AI can’t digest. No data, no insights. It’s like trying to run a restaurant without ingredients.

We’ve been here before. Think of that complex IVR system that had to be mapped out, step by step. Who’s calling? What do they want? What data powers the experience? The same logic applies to AI - just more complex, with higher expectations.

To move forward, businesses need more than buzzwords - they need concrete use cases that clearly explain what problem is being solved, for whom, and how. And let’s not forget: users typically only tap into 10% of Microsoft Office’s features. Adoption has always been a challenge - and with AI, it’s likely worse.

Want to Sell AI? Make It Simple

If you’re selling AI, treat it like a band-aid: easy to apply, obvious in value, and clearly better than the alternative. That means:

Focused, low-risk use cases

Clear ROI within weeks, not years

Pre-configured outcomes with minimal setup

Until then, the hype might just be your biggest competitor.

In the first phase of this collaboration, VodafoneThree will build two masts on site to provide 5G mobile coverage for the Suffolk site and the surrounding community.

VodafoneThree’s partner, Fern Communications will provide radio coverage eliminating potential communication black spots throughout the Sizewell C construction site.

One of the biggest clean energy projects in Britain, Sizewell C will generate 7% of the UK’s electricity needs, providing low-carbon electricity to 6m homes for at least 60 years and saving 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere annually.

The 5G coverage and radio will benefit Sizewell C’s operations enhancing communication among workers, and better mobile infrastructure will support the exchange of data and updates, improving the overall efficiency and productivity of the construction process.

The deployed fibre will complement the 5G coverage and enhance operational efficiency.

The connectivity project, which began in November 2024, aims to help support construction site safety, security and efficiency, and strengthen mobile connectivity across the site, as well as providing better local connectivity for residents and businesses.

Damian Leydon, Sizewell C Site Delivery Director said: “Connectivity is vital for this project and a reliable connection helps us to operate at high standards of safety and efficiency, and working with VodafoneThree and Fern Communications to provide what we need on site also has the added benefit of providing 5G for the local area too.”

Nick Gliddon, Business Director, VodafoneThree (pictured) said: “Alongside our contractors, we will deliver robust, secure, and resilient communications infrastructure that is essential to the success of one of the UK’s most significant energy projects and to support the UK’s transition to cleaner energy.”"

“We’re now able to return to some of our managed services roots, with the addition of cybersecurity services, and as operators of extensive, high-capacity infrastructure, we have expertise in-house already, so customers know that they’re getting advice from real practitioners.

“The addition of the Optimity and 40fi teams gives us some immediate scale to address those customer needs, with the same vertically integrated approach that they’ve come to expect.”

In addition, Vorboss has also invested in Layer8, a software platform that allows building operators to automate, manage, and monetise their networks, and gives building managers, MSPs, and non-technical users secure control over on-site network infrastructure.

Customers can now purchase managed IT, cybersecurity, and connectivity services from Vorboss – either bundled together or individually, and these will be extended to their channel partners, enabling them to expand their offerings."

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/comms-vision-convention-2025/comms-vision-conference-2025-delivering-outcome-and-value-bonus,17-07-2025,Comms Vision Conference 2025: Delivering an Outcome and Value Bonus,"Achieving strong and sustained growth in a competitive market calls for a multifaceted approach and a focus on where to evolve and where to reinvent – but the imperative to deliver ‘more for less’ to exacting customers further complicates the conundrum. Therefore, this year’s gold standard Comms Vision Convention (12th-14th November, Gleneagles) doubles down on how to create a model that brings Outcome and Value Bonuses (OVBs) not just for end users, but also for MSPs needing to optimise their own operations to ensure long-term, and streamlined, business growth.

The biggest challenges facing MSPs today are to ensure more business growth at no extra cost while delivering higher value to customers along with productivity gains for their own organisation. But driving business transformation in a competitive and saturated market, with pressure from end users wanting more for less from their tech investments and MSP relationships, how far, and where, do MSPs need to evolve and reinvent to meet these demands and differentiate? Is sticking to your knitting an option when solving this new customer RoI and MSP efficiency equation?

Customer demand for an Outcome and Value Bonus will only intensify, but how to deliver more RoI and grow at the same time is the challenge facing channel firms. Solving this equation is key to sustained competitive success

Striking the right balance between evolution and reinvention to drive value and deliver more outcomes – while growing your business more efficiently – will be the pivotal factor when planning for competitive success. This also brings into question the viability of traditional channel models.

Customer demand for OVBs will only intensify, but how to deliver more RoI and grow at the same time is the strategic challenge facing channel firms. To help unravel this conundrum Comms Vision will, in part, explore how the critical field of Enhanced Consultancy will become the new competitive battlefield, and how gaining control of margin erosion can also help MSPs deliver the more for less business agenda.

Key questions

1. In order to meet today’s and tomorrow’s customer OVB expectations, which parts of your own operations, platforms and GTM will need rethinking or reinventing? Is your consultancy practice good enough to compete long-term? Have you got control of margin erosion? Are you making the right decisions?

2. How should technology/vendor partnerships evolve to maximise RoI for customers and your own business?

3. How can you ensure that your workforce is future-ready to drive exceptional value for all stakeholders?

Comms Vision’s agenda will show how an interconnected approach to overcoming these siloed challenges will enable MSPs to create a blueprint for delivering more customer value, while securing their business’s long-term viability through...

The Interconnected Solve

1. Strike the right balance

Pairing your own company’s efficiency and productivity roadmap with revenue growth strategies is now a priority. And understanding where to focus when developing a future-fit operational, GTM, CX and customer value approach will be the silver bullet. This involves harnessing today’s technology, including AI powered end-to-end data management, and tackling the age old problem of how to erase the impacts of margin erosion on performance – which is too often overlooked despite its potential to help MSPs deliver more for less. We also explore how matching operational excellence to Enhanced Consultancy practices could make a decisive difference in the evolving ICT market battleground.

2. Forge the right partnerships

MSP and customer priorities are inseparable from the broader channel ecosystem, which brings into focus the future direction of strategic partnerships which are under pressure to be more intertwined and strategically aligned, in order to target the right tech and business markets, drive growth through greater collaboration, operational and platform efficiency, and promote integration and automation between partners. But how far is the channel’s supply chain responding to these pressures and evolving in order to deliver compelling OVBs? And are we moving fast enough?

3. Fire up your team power

Comms Vision will also focus on how this all links into the evolution of an agile MSP workforce fit for the future, primed to help deliver more outcome-led value through the elevation of your organisation’s capacity to innovate, disrupt and grow through a thriving people strategy. Building a workforce that’s responsive to change and new opportunities is vital for long-term success, and how to meet this challenge successfully hinges on your people and teamwork – just as much as the strategic business decisions you make. But how can we prepare for that mindset shift today?

4. Decide on next moves

Knowing what to consider when transition planning for a stronger future is a challenge for MSP leaders, therefore Comms Vision has set out to provide a framework that incorporates recommendations and guidance to help inform the astute decision making required to strike the right balance between evolution and reinvention, and deliver sustainable OVBs to customers while driving your own growth agenda.

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/cyber-threat/unmanaged-devices-expose-businesses-cyber-threats-says-research,17-07-2025,"Unmanaged devices expose businesses to cyber threats, says research","A new study has revealed security vulnerabilities in UK businesses, with nearly half of companies experiencing data breaches caused by unmanaged or unseen devices in the past year alone.

The research, “Bridging the Visibility Gap,” was carried out by unified endpoint management provider Scalefusion surveying IT leaders across the UK, and uncovered critical blind spots in enterprise device management that are leaving organisations exposed to cyber threats.

Key survey findings showed that more than two-thirds (67%) of IT leaders lack complete visibility into all work devices across their organisation, with nearly a quarter (23.5%) detecting unauthorised devices accessing corporate data at least monthly, and with over a third of breach victims experiencing attacks monthly.

Only 35% of IT leaders feel very confident in their team's ability to quickly contain and remediate security incidents.

The study reveals that the shift to hybrid and remote working has created challenges for IT security teams, and 64% of organisations discovered previously unknown devices or applications being used for work purposes in the last year, highlighting the extent of shadow IT operations.

Frequent security incidents among affected companies showed that among the 48% who experienced breaches from unmanaged devices, over a third (35%) reported facing attacks on at least a monthly basis, indicating that these are not isolated incidents but ongoing, systematic vulnerabilities.

The research also exposed how organisations' attempts to address security challenges may be making matters worse. 59% of companies are using four or more different endpoint security tools, creating a complex web of systems that's proving counterproductive – and this tool proliferation is causing significant operational challenges.

Only 7% of organisations claimed to face no problems from their multi-tool approach.

Sally King, Channel Sales Manager UK&I at Scalefusion (pictured) commented: “These findings confirm that there's a critical gap between the security challenges organisations face and their ability to address them effectively. Visibility and simplification is needed, with a unified approach that brings all endpoints under one management umbrella rather than juggling multiple disconnected systems.”

The study suggests that organisations recognising these challenges and moving toward unified solutions are better positioned to address the evolving threat landscape while reducing operational complexity."

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/cloud/analyse-cloud-costs-closely-tangible-roi-says-akamai-report,15-07-2025,"Analyse cloud costs closely for tangible ROI, says Akamai report","New research from Akamai Technologies reveals that businesses across Europe are facing rising cloud infrastructure costs and are struggling to realise value from AI investments, with a ‘significant disconnect’ between cloud and AI spending and the ability to measure tangible returns.

It also shows that businesses are making cuts to their AI, cybersecurity, and IT staffing budgets to accommodate growing cloud costs.

According to Akamai’s findings in the Opinium report, polling 750 IT decision makers in the UK, France and Germany responsible for cloud software & infrastructure and/or AI applications, only 35% of EMEA businesses stay with their current cloud provider because they are satisfied and see no need to explore alternatives.

Research also found that 67% expect cloud costs to rise over the next year, with 42% anticipating increases of more than 10%. Cloud storage, analytics (39%), and AI-related services (37%) were the top factors behind the increased spending.

Despite the anticipated cost rises, two in five say that the cost and complexity of migrating data and applications outweigh the potential benefits of switching providers.

Over two-thirds (68%) of businesses are finding that increasing cloud costs are translating into less budget for other areas. As cloud spending accelerates due to the growing demands of AI, businesses are under pressure to reduce costs in other areas, with new AI projects (26%), cybersecurity (26%), and IT staff costs (24%) among the most frequently cited cutbacks. These trade-offs prompted one in five businesses to brand their cloud computing costs as “unmanageable.”

James Kretchmar, Global CTO, Cloud Technology at Akamai Technologies (pictured) said: “Cloud spending is growing fast and it’s holding businesses back from investing in growth and innovation, especially with AI, where businesses are struggling to squeeze ROI out of their investments.

“Against this backdrop, cloud hyperscalers continue with contract lock-in and egress pricing, which means keeping cloud costs under control is impossible for many.”

AI ambition is high, with 65% of businesses expecting to increase AI investment in the next 12 months. However, nearly 85% have not implemented a strategy for tracking return on investment (ROI) for their AI projects, with only 11% reporting their AI projects self-sustaining through cost or productivity gains.

And just a quarter report having budgets that fully support their desired AI initiatives.

Kretchmar continued: “Leaders need to take a hard look at where they’re spending and what outcomes they expect. Companies must prioritise the quality of outcomes, looking beyond the legacy cloud providers to those architected for performance-sensitive applications like inference.”

AI inference plays a critical role in automation, real-time decision-making and predictive analytics across a range of industries and applies this learning to new data in real time.

Running AI inference at the edge reduces latency and enables scalable, efficient execution avoiding dependence on centralised cloud platforms, and it is essential to shift computing workloads from the cloud to the edge.

Akamai is supporting organisations in moving beyond traditional cloud models and achieving greater efficiency and value from their AI strategies."

Gary Cole, CEO at Lumilinks said: “Data and applications shouldn’t be about the technical audience — it’s about the business user. Our goal is to find a business user with a problem and solve it, delivering realised business impact and measurable ROI.

“When we entered the challenge, we didn’t want to pitch a concept that only sounded good in theory - we wanted to show something real, proven, and delivering value today. For industries like utilities, logistics, and field services — often underserved or slower to adopt AI — even small improvements can have an outsized impact.

“That’s why we start by identifying and solving high-impact problems, designing AI that is easy to adopt, integrates with existing processes, and delivers clear ROI.”

During the pitch at Snowflake Summit, the judges focused on two things: real, proven business impact and serving industries that have often been left behind by the AI revolution.

Lumilinks has built natively on Snowflake to accelerate the development of other solutions including Smart Insights, executive-ready BI dashboards and live reporting in Streamlit, and Smart Repair, which helps engineers and service managers book cost-effective repairs.

Cole concluded: “We believe AI adoption should be about results you can measure. Every engagement includes a value report showing exactly what was invested, what’s projected, and what’s being achieved.

The contract is procured under the YPO Framework on which MLL was accepted less than three months ago and supports a digital unification ‘Network Alignment’ programme following Pobl Group’s recent merger with Linc Cymru.

This will create the largest housing association in Wales and to be rebranded Codi Group from January 2026.

The newly expanded group will manage 24,000 homes in Wales with plans for growth to deliver more than 4,500 new homes over the next five years. The group employs more than 3,000 people.

Ahead of the rebrand, MLL will transition around 200 Pobl and Linc Cymru MPLS legacy sites onto a unified, secure SD-WAN network that will feature a Zero-trust architecture with managed real-time threat detection and response, and integration with Azure Public Cloud to allow cross-organisation collaboration.

It is hoped the project will save more than half a million pounds over the three-year period through streamlined procurement and infrastructure consolidation.

Peter Murphy, Head of Technology Operations, Pobl Group said: “By merging two legacy MPLS networks into a single SD-WAN managed service, we’re enabling collaboration, enhanced cyber resilience and smarter service delivery for our teams and tenants.”

Gail Harvey, Business Development Director at MLL (pictured) added: “MLL has won this significant UK housing association contract, especially in a competitive tender situation where quality rather than price alone were the deciding factors for Pobl in terms of our demonstrating technology, engineering expertise and support, and customer service."""

Commenting on the conference agenda – which was tailored to provide a springboard for the development of best practice in channel businesses across a framework of Insight Sessions and Tracks focused on Sales, Marketing, Leadership and Technology – Partner Week Ambassador Katie Sloan (Marketing Director, CloudClevr - pictured below), enthused: ""The UK Partner Week Summit was a valuable opportunity to reflect on where the channel is headed, and how we continue to adapt, particularly in marketing, sales and customer value creation.

""The sessions sparked the kind of candid, cross-functional conversations we need more of, not just between vendors and partners, but between leadership, marketing, sales and technology teams.

""Furthermore, the panel discussions around talent development, harnessing ambition, and proposition building with differentiation in a crowded market were especially timely given the pace of change in the industry - and the risk that comes with playing it safe.""

Risc IT Solutions and Novem IT CEO Alex Heslip (UK Partner Week Summit delegate), emphasised the collaborative nature of the event and its focus on partnerships and knowledge sharing: ""I had a productive time attending the Partner Week event. It was a great opportunity to connect with multiple suppliers all in one place, making the interactions highly efficient. And the shared insights were truly beneficial.""

Paul Cunningham, UK Partner Week Summit Content Director, added: ""The business technology partner landscape is evolving at breakneck speed and the businesses that thrive are those that adapt, innovate and lead from the front.

""Against this backdrop, the UK Partner Week Summit was high impact, bringing together industry visionaries, successful practitioners and forward-thinking leaders for a day that helped delegates reshape how they approach growth, leadership and competitive advantage, whether they are channel veterans or navigating their career path.""

Setting the tone for the day was Jason Bevan, former Head of Development at Warner Bros, who opens the summit with an exploration of how VAR and MSP leaders can apply entertainment industry innovation principles to drive business transformation. The Summit closed with Karen Blackett OBE, former President at WPP whose remarkable career trajectory and leadership philosophy have made her one of the UK’s most respected business leaders.

The two deals will help Econocom deliver complex, end-to-end AV integration projects for education, public-sector and corporate clients in the UK and Ireland.

Combined with existing resources, these businesses now offer consultancy, design, installation, integration, maintenance, and support for AV environments of every scale across the UK and Ireland.

The deals also add more than 55 AV specialists to Econocom’s UK and Ireland team, strengthening local delivery and bolstering the company’s growing AV integration capabilities across Europe.

The purchase of ISSAV follows Econocom’s recent acquisitions in Spain and Germany, and will contribute to a €300m-plus European AV business.

Smartcomm, which is already fully integrated into Econocom, brings an established presence in AV and infrastructure integration, with experience in delivering large-scale AV projects in corporate headquarters, universities and public-sector estates.

ISSAV, in which the previous owners retain a 33% stake, has more than 30 years integration experience and a loyal Irish customer base of more than 150 organisations across the education, public and corporate sectors.

Both acquisitions form part of a €225m investment programme that aims to consolidate fragmented national AV markets and strengthen the One Econocom transformation plan.



Israel Garcia, UK Country Manager and Managing Director of Business Development and Strategic Plan at Econocom Group said: “Smartcomm and ISSAV are trusted AV integrators with strong track records in their respective markets.

“Wmakes them such a strong fit for Econocom, is a shared commitment to delivering complete, integrated AV and IT solutions to customers.”

Hutt created 4com in 1999, starting with just a phone, a phone book and a vision of improving the telecom solutions for Britain’s SME market.

He led the business for the quarter-century that followed, ultimately becoming its Chairman and Managing Director.

Throughout his time leading 4com, Hutt routinely sought to make the business a desirable place to work by offering benefits which helped the company win prestigious awards such as The Sunday Times’ Best Companies to Work for in 2017.

He continued to make people a focus; in 2022 he drew national attention for giving every member of his then 450-strong team a £200 per month Energy Support Bonus, to assist with spiralling energy costs, without expecting any acclaim.

A statement on the 4com website said: “The telecoms sector would undoubtedly be a different place without Daron’s influence. There are many companies in the sector today which have been founded by people who have previously worked at 4com, and have gone on to put their own perspective about what they learned under his leadership.”

Hutt leaves behind a legacy of success, seen in the careers of the 550 staff currently employed at 4com, those who have gone on to success elsewhere, and the company he created."

But too many resellers still face limited choice, inflated prices, and carrier lock-in. In a market where agility is everything, channel partners need genuine choice, backed by competitive pricing and reliable support.

That’s where independent wholesale aggregators like VeloxServ are changing the game. As a fully independent, wholesale[1]only Full Fibre connectivity aggregator, VeloxServ isn’t tied to a single network or provider. Instead, it currently aggregates services from major carriers across the UK, including Openreach, CityFibre, Virgin Media O2 and Vodafone. More recently VeloxServ has also forged new relationships with other leading network providers such as ITS, FullFibre, Freedom Fibre and Vorboss, giving partners access and further depth to a truly comprehensive portfolio of broadband and Ethernet services.

This independence brings freedom. No bias, no upselling, no lock-in. Just clear, competitive pricing and fast quoting across multiple carriers, enabling faster sales cycles, better margins, and more customer choice.

But VeloxServ doesn’t just simplify pricing, it adds value across the customer journey as it continues to enhance its offering to partners. Further exciting developments to its partner portal in the coming months include a more expansive and intelligent pricing engine which allows partners to generate instant, location-specific quotes and order connectivity services seamlessly and efficiently.

The business has been founded on providing the highest quality customer service and technical support to service management and provisioning. And with a channel-only approach, partners never compete with VeloxServ for end users – removing a long-standing frustration that many face with larger providers.

At its core, VeloxServ is built around empowering partners. Its model enables MSPs, and ISPs to deliver tailored solutions that meet real-world business needs, without compromise on quality, price, or flexibility.

In an industry where choice equals competitive edge, VeloxServ offers a smarter way to buy and sell connectivity. For partners looking to grow, differentiate, and retain customers, it’s not just an aggregator – it’s a strategic ally.

With technology evolving rapidly and customer expectations higher than ever, UK businesses can’t afford to wait months for traditional finance to come through.

That’s why more and more are turning to asset finance—a flexible, fast, and future-ready way to invest in the tools, vehicles, and tech they need to grow.

In 2025, economic uncertainty and cautious lending from banks have made traditional finance harder to access. At the same time, businesses are under pressure to innovate, adapt, and deliver—without tying up valuable capital.

Asset finance offers a smarter alternative. It allows businesses to:

Preserve cash flow by spreading the cost of equipment over time

Access the latest assets without large upfront payments

Manage risk with flexible terms that suit today’s unpredictable environment

At Shire Leasing, we’ve been helping UK businesses unlock growth through asset finance for over 35 years. We understand that it’s not just about funding—it’s about finding the right solution, fast.

Designed as a full support ecosystem, it gives partners the tools, products and incentives they need to grow with confidence and stay ahead of market demands.

One partner seeing the impact of the programme first-hand is Dental IT, a specialist in IT networks for dental practices, who joined the programme in early 2024 looking to enhance their product offering.

As a programme member, Dental IT gained early access to PXC’s future-ready broadband and Zoom products – helping them bring the latest technologies to their niche market quickly to stay competitive. With dedicated training and support from PXC specialists, they were also able to upskill their teams fast, delivering better outcomes and service for their clients.

What stood out most, however, was the quarterly incentive scheme, which rewards partners for their growth. In the past 12 months, Dental IT have won the scheme three times and used their vouchers to fund team-building experiences for their employees.

In November 2024, Dental IT used their incentive vouchers for a team[1]building day at The Cube in Manchester. Continued success has earned them two more vouchers this year, which they’re planning to use for more memorable experiences.

“We used the vouchers to fund team-building days that brought everyone together. It was a chance to step away from day[1]to-day pressures, reward hard work and strengthen team culture.” - Liam McNaughton, Consulting Director, Dental IT.

These rewards did more than boost morale for Dental IT. They encouraged the team to explore more of PXC’s portfolio and make full use of platforms like the partner portal 1Portal, to improve their internal processes and expand what they could offer customers.

“Dental IT are a great example of how our programme can deliver for partners who engage with it. They’ve enhanced their offering, earned financial rewards and used those to invest in their people.” - Paul Smith, Chief Sales & Product Strategy Officer, PXC

For partners like Dental IT, the PXC Partner Programme delivers real growth, stronger teams and lasting rewards.

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/sponsored-content/4-pillars-modern-sales-how-sell-when-growth,09-07-2025,The 4 Pillars of Modern Sales: How to Sell When Growth,"Two important facts about sales. One, you need a plan, a strategy, a framework for sales. Two, fundamentals are required and need to be executed as best as possible and always improving.

The industry got lazy in 2020. Anyone that answered a phone was able to close a UC&C order. Not a sale, because no real selling was going on – just order taking. Now that cloud comms growth is in single digits, selling is required.

Sales people have gotten lazy on fundamentals too. They skip steps; hurry to close the deal. Meanwhile, Enterprise sales are slowing down. They take longer because of the macroeconomic environment and that more people are involved in the decision. Every sale is getting harder to bring to ink.

We need to go back to the 4 pillars: Focus/ Target; Positioning/Why?; Messaging/Earn Trust; Where to fish and how.

Number one: WHO BENEFITS THE MOST FROM YOUR SERVICES? The problem with most providers is that they think Everyone is a Customer. Unless you are BT or Orange that is incorrect. Even for those two giants, it isn’t everyone any more. There is a section of the marketplace that you can serve best. There is product-market fit. For that segment of the market, the service delivery results in benefits for the business. Look at your customers to see if any verticals or sizes or other characteristics stick out. What about your top customers is similar?

The second pillar is of course marketing. Positioning is about defining how your company is the best at something that the market cares about. It is part of defining the value proposition. The why you instead of the thousand other SPs that offer UC too. It is about benefits, customer needs, and your unique differentiator. An example of this could be that you are the best at delivering a communications platform to Zoho customers with 10 to 99 employees who achieve a 15% productivity gain from the combination.

Now you may be thinking: that cuts our addressable market to a fraction. The largest US CLEC had 55K customers. 8x8 has 55K global businesses using their services. Zoom has 4,192 customers billing $100K+ in ARR. Think about the next 100 or 1000 customers that you want to acquire; not the next 100,000 or million.

The third pillar is Messaging. What are you saying to prospects and the market? Are you telling stories or pushing out PR? With AI replacing search, SEO won’t be as effective as stories about benefits and outcomes.

What are stories valuable? Our brains are wired for stories. It is how we pass down human history. The use case could be a story about the impact your services had on a customer. If it was a good story, it would be memorable, which makes it repeatable and sticky. Sales Engineers are good at sales because they can map features to benefits and translate the technical to the business need. In telecom we push product; but businesses especially SMB buy solutions, not products. They don’t buy technology but what the tech can do for the business.

The final pillar is Where does the sales team fish? That depends. Start in your network. Look at verticals. Do you have former customers? It needs to be multi-threaded with cold outreach, referrals, networking, and other avenues. There is still money in emails. Social media can work. Obviously, this is more effort than before but that is just what is required now.

Story-telling, Positioning, Targeting. And fishing are the 4 pillars of a sales plan that coupled with executing well on the sales fundaments is the path to success for providers.

A shipping container with the equipment is being transported to north-east Africa and will be received by Lyra in Africa and distributed to ten schools, set to arrive in Dar es Salaam in early September.

This will provide students and teachers access to digital tools and online resources and for many, it will be the first time in their lives.

All the equipment in the container has been donated by Softcat’s IT services and recycling partner Greensafe and some customers.

Items were securely refurbished and packaged by Greensafe ready for shipment, with some donated equipment also sold to other organisations to fund specific technology needed by the schools.

The refurbished equipment includes monitors, power cables, access points, switches, printers, keyboards, mice, headsets, projectors, projector screens and interactive whiteboards.

This collaborative project between Softcat, Greensafe and Lyra, marks the second time both IT organisations have engaged in this initiative, with the first container being shipped to Tanzania two years ago.

Ashleigh Baker, Cyber Architecture Services Team Lead and one of Softcat's Love2Give Network Leads said: “The work that Lyra is doing to provide safe, quality education for girls in rural Tanzania is nothing short of transformative.

“Thanks to the generous support of Greensafe, we’ve been able to donate vital equipment that will help unlock access to technical education, opening doors that were previously closed to these students.”

Softcat has supported Lyra’s initiatives over a three-year partnership by building a new hostel for girls at one of its secondary schools, delivering two containers of refurbished IT equipment in collaboration with Greensafe, helping to build a new donation platform, developing the Finnish area of Lyra’s website and through financial donations."

The software solutions provider has seen rapid growth since CEO Phil Doye (pictured) acquired the business in 2019, and it has now moved to snap up Hertfordshire-based CAE, which had a turnover of £159.8m in its year to June 30th 2024.

The acquisition will strengthen boxxe’s market position as a key provider of software, solutions and services in both the public and private sectors.

The deal complements the company’s acquisition of Total Computer Networks in February last year, when boxxe resolved to grow its customer base and expand solutions offerings.

boxxe’s capabilities within networking and security are strengthened by CAE’s top-level accreditations which include being a Cisco Tier One Gold Partner and a Microsoft Tier One Cloud Solution Provider (CSP).

CAE has top-level partnerships with Microsoft, Dell and Cisco.

With boxxe already recognised as one of Microsoft’s top UK licensing partners and holding Titanium status with Dell, it was CAE’s Gold status with the latter that was the real appeal.

In addition to its presence in the private sector, CAE has a strong customer base in education and healthcare sectors that will benefit from the additional framework access and public sector expertise that boxxe provides.

Doye commented: “I have followed CAE for many years and continue to be impressed by the organisation’s practices in networking, security, and cloud infrastructure.

“CAE sets itself apart from the competition with its focus on customer outcomes,” he said, pinpointing CAE’s in-house software development arm CAE Labs as an example.

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/leadership-and-strategy/preparing-opportunity-rich-and-successful-future,04-07-2025,"Preparing for an opportunity-rich, and successful future","How to continue succeeding in an opportunity rich technology and business environment is a question facing many channel leaders under pressure to continuously stand out from the crowd and unclear about how to prepare themselves for ongoing long-term success. To help unravel the issues, BT Wholesale hosted a working lunch last month attended by leading MSPs and led by leadership coach Cally Beaton.

Adapting to market change and leading from the front is key to being ultra-competitive, so Beaton unravelled the multifaceted challenges and opportunities facing today’s business leaders in the channel, and why they should ‘choose courage over comfort’ to compete more effectively, and ultimately turn each strategic decision and product expansion into a breakthrough event for their business.

For context, this channel insight session was held on the back of BT Wholesale’s launch of Teams Phone Mobile, a timely solution for resellers wanting to tap into surging demand for UC and collaboration tools. Today, Microsoft Teams has well over 320 million monthly active users and in 2023 Cavell estimated that only around 17 million are using Teams with telephony enabled – forecasting a massive rise to 40 million by 2027 (mainly in North America and Western Europe). Bolt on the fact that the broader UC market is tipped to be worth £155 billion by 2030 and the scale of the Microsoft Teams channel growth opportunity becomes crystal clear, so long as a bold, targeted and outcome-led value-building GTM approach is adopted.

Shifting mindsets towards outcomes and adding value will prove the key differentiator for MSPs

Shifting mindsets towards delivering outcomes and adding value will prove the key differentiator for MSPs moving forward, according to leaders attending the session. The discussion also pointed up how the way resellers and MSPs deliver services is changing, based on the imperative to build deeper customer relationships and create greater value.

GTM strategy

But what is the best GTM approach for resellers wanting to attach high revenue, high margin services that drive more value and help them to differentiate? According to Maintel CEO Dan Davies, market differentiation has entered its third phase. He identified phase one as being speed and quality of installation, and categorised phase two as being how well you run your own systems. Phase three requires a consultative approach that delivers personalised solutions. “This is the only way to avoid a race to the bottom which is inevitable when you are selling the same solutions as those around you,” he said.

Peter Watson, UC&C Product Manager at Wavenet, highlighted how he is changing the company’s sales behaviours to reflect this trend. “The old school sales mentality is to assume you lost a deal because the other party had a solution you aren’t offering,” he added. “This mindset leads to a bloated and unfocused portfolio that makes it harder for teams to sell and bundle. Instead, look at what more could have been done through a consultative process.”

This isn’t just a sales imperative, but something that marketers must also consider, according to Christopher Wellbelove DL (pictured left), Senior Marketing Consultant at BT Wholesale. He said: “Marketing hasn’t hit the sweet spot yet – messaging is too focused around technologies and their features, not the solutions they help to solve.”

Meeting customer expectations

To deliver on the outcome expectations of customers, each MSP in attendance is narrowing their scope to ensure service is more tailored to specific verticals. Maintel has begun to focus on four key verticals, which were chosen after a comparison of areas where it is seeing success alongside identified high-growth markets.

Digital Space has also gone through the process of focusing on where it can provide the most value. Richard Beeston, CTO/COO, added: “We built a £60 million monolith and have realised we can’t be everything to everybody. We are now looking at verticals where we can have the best conversations and are building technology stacks around the needs of those markets.”

Courage

At the heart of this new mindset is courage, according to Alex Mawson, Product and Marketing Director (Mobile) at Giacom. He noted: “Sometimes you must be brave and tell customers you can’t deliver something. If you promise to deliver everything, you are going to erode trust in the future so focus your energy where you can be an expert because that is where trust is delivered.”

Wavenet has built verticalised strategies into its feedback loop. Sam Phillips, Mobile Product Manager, stated: “From a mobile point of view, we tell our teams to be active with questions so we can start to build a profile around the needs of a vertical. At the end of the day, it’s about providing what the customer wants, rather than what you want to provide the customer.”

Gavin Jones (pictured left), Director of Wholesale Channel at BT Business, extolled the virtues of bundling around certain verticals, and even at the more granular level of employee profiles. He added: “If you are a business selling individual solutions, you are missing a big opportunity. Start to bring pieces together and create bespoke communications packages.” He recommends unique bundles for mobile workers, desk workers and customer service workers. “This proactive approach is more targeted and easier to manage in the long run,” he added.

Davies noted that this approach is in demand due to increased uncertainty in the end user base. He believes 90 per cent of Maintel’s customers just want to be advised. “They don’t care what the solution is, they just want it to work,” he said. “They aren’t tapped into a large technology strategy, their strategy is about where their business is in the now. Success for them is great outcomes without having to think about their resilience and security.”

If you’re selling individual solutions you’re missing a big opportunity. Bring pieces together and create bespoke communications packages

This all plays into the opportunity for resellers to capitalise on growing interest in UCaaS and collaboration platforms that integrate directly with Microsoft Teams and other applications, noted Jones. “Most businesses know that the age of the desk-bound phone system is a thing of the past,” he commented.

“Hybrid working is the norm and UCaaS delivers streamlined communications and collaboration tools. Adding mobile capabilities enhances the offering further, and channel partners can establish themselves as indispensable technology enablers if they can provide it.”"
Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/cloud/more-effective-cloud-costs-visibility-needed-says-ekco-survey,04-07-2025,"More effective cloud costs visibility needed, says Ekco survey","New research from Ekco reveals that more than half of businesses cannot effectively track their cloud spending, potentially undermining billions in infrastructure investment, and costing organisations significant value.

The Ekco Infrastructure Modernisation Survey of over 1,000 IT decision makers across the UK and Ireland shows that there is a quiet revolution underway in the cloud - and that it’s causing businesses to sleepwalk into unforeseen risks.

After years of wishful thinking, hybrid cloud adoption is hitting the mainstream - but for most firms, it’s still uncharted territory.

As companies ramp up infrastructure modernisation efforts, the survey reveals that only one-third (33%) of cloud projects deliver on every goal.

This gap between partial and complete success is affecting companies, with many struggling to measure true return on investment due to poor cost visibility.

Legacy infrastructure continues to be a major drag on innovation, with 71% of organisations reporting that outdated on-prem technology is actively holding them back.

Among those still relying heavily on legacy systems, 70% believe migrating to the cloud could reduce costs - yet 46% cite management failing to prioritise cloud migration as a key barrier.

James Young, Head of Technical Solution Architecture at Ekco (pictured) said: “Organisations are making substantial cloud investments, but without proper cost visibility and optimisation, they're essentially flying blind.

“The jump to 68% hybrid adoption shows businesses want more control and governance, but that comes with complexity – a challenge that lends itself to a ‘FinOps’ approach, bringing together internal engineering, finance and business teams to ensure smarter, and more accountable cloud spending.”

The research also reveals interesting cultural shifts, with 82% reporting that moving to cloud helps create a more agile culture, suggesting the benefits extend far beyond technical improvements to fundamental business transformation.

The survey suggests that while cloud momentum remains strong with 98% of organisations considering cloud moves, the focus must shift from basic adoption to sophisticated optimisation and governance."
Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/channel-forecast/business-updates-point-strong-h2-performances,04-07-2025,Business updates point to strong H2 performances,"Last month’s Channel Forecast insight session gauged the business outlooks of three channel firms, assessing H1 company performance, their take on market trends, growth hotspots, the shift towards outcomes versus simple reselling, the channel engagement strategies that work best and what this all means for resellers and MSPs in H2 and beyond.

There’s plenty of scope for optimism in the coming six months, according to our panel of three industry experts, each reporting good growth, and all preparing for an H2 uptick. “We’ve had a strong first half of the year, measuring growth across most of our products and technologies with clear momentum in all the right areas compared to 2024,” said Ralph Mora, VP & GM EMEA Region, Nuso. “We are doing especially well where cloud adoption is maturing and have had a bright spot in integrating Microsoft Teams and Zoom Phone into our business telephony suite. We’re still building out this ecosystem so that partners can grow through a broader reach with richer solutions.”

Despite a slower first quarter, Evolve IP has also seen growth pick up with record attendees at its April partner day. It is also planning an H2 spike by doubling down on its Microsoft play via the impending launch of Operator Connect. “We’ve built an ecosystem around the Microsoft piece with call recording, analytics and contact centre,” said Sales Director Jamie Hughes.

He also highlighted churn from smaller customers as another trend to keep an eye on. “This doesn’t have to be a negative, larger customers are stickier and one or two deals can make up for churn,” he said. “Our strategy is to point customers at the mid-market and enterprise space and avoid the low-end which can be a race to the bottom.”

VeloxServ has also driven year-on-year growth, according to Head of Marketing Rob Tickle, having ramped up its connectivity offering and signing up a raft of new suppliers. He said that VeloxServ’s priority is to go all-in on marketing and partner enablement to add new resellers and deepen its relationship with existing partners. “The goal is around equipping our ISP and MSP partners with the right data, insight collateral and all the tools they need to be able to sell their value-added solutions confidently and differentiate themselves,” he said, noting that VeloxServ is aiming at the SME and mid-market customer base where demand is high for infrastructure.

All agreed that H1 trends were especially seen in changing customer spending habits. This is not characterised by a tightening of purse strings, but by more selective and strategic investment. Hughes commented: “Customers are retaining the same amount of spend but they are being more targeted about its deployment.”

Mora expanded on the point: “Customers are redirecting their spend towards platforms and services, often seeking more measurable impacts and looking to extract value from the existing technologies that they have.” Tickle summarised that customers are trying to spend smarter by ‘prioritising reliability, efficiency and a more long-term return on investment’. He also noted an uptick in demand for flexible, scalable solutions.

Changing perceptions around value mean vendors must facilitate a change in their go-to-market approach for resellers. Mora explained: “The best-performing and smartest resellers aren’t just chasing revenue, they’re building relevance and resilience to make their customer relationships stickier. Relevance means staying aligned with customer expectations, so these resellers are looking for vendors who offer flexible go-to-market options and strong enablement pieces.”

Hughes also emphasised the new value perceptions facing resellers, as well as Evolve IP’s enablement strategy. He said: “If you go into a meeting and talk about features you’re going to be brushed aside. It’s now about measurable outcomes and long-term value.”

To accommodate this, Evolve IP has restructured its sales teams, implementing Technical Account Managers to deliver on outcomes. The company has also invested in tools that chew customer data to quantify business-specific efficiency savings. He added: “It is tangible and personalised and gives something for a CFO or wider buying committee to buy into.”

VeloxServ is also shifting how it does business alongside partners. Tickle said: “Our partner engagements now focus more on collaboration and cooperation, not just the reselling of services. It’s strategic enablement that we’re offering because that’s where the real value is. The winners ultimately will be those that can guide their customers through complexities and deliver tangible results at the end of it.”

Nuso is also facilitating an outcome-based approach for partners by offering a range of options. “We’re constantly investing in technology to enable partners to keep adding value added services to their customers, through our own IP investments and through the acquisition of turnkey technologies,” said Mora. “It’s about allowing customers to enhance existing technology and then migrate, when convenient, to new platforms.

“Our job is to help partners become advisors, not just sellers. If they win customers on trust and on value, we will all grow. Investing the time with the customer and truly understanding their business objectives, their model and their future aspirations remains a central tenet to our channel model.”

Where this approach can be particularly effective for resellers is when specialising down to specific verticals, according to Hughes. He extols the benefit of finding niche markets that resellers can totally own. He said: “If you can package the best solutions and position them in a way that addresses a sector’s niche needs, perhaps with the help of an industry expert, then that world is your oyster. You will build momentum through word of mouth and a growing base of case studies. From a valuation point of view that is going to be a lot more appealing to some buyers.”

This consultative approach requires tighter strategic proximity between suppliers and partners than ever before. Therefore, a key theme throughout the discussion was the steps being taken by vendors to become easier to do business with. Tickle added: “Growth comes from strategic collaboration so our focus is on being as frictionless to work with as possible.”

This is also a focus for Nuso which has relaunched its global websites to be more relevant to customers selling on outcomes. This came alongside a portal relaunch, a new platform allowing for numbering and porting selection and work on toolchain enablement. Evolve IP has taken a similar approach in addressing its partner portal and integrations, enabling its partners to begin provisioning their own numbers rather than having to raise a ticket.

Efficiency matters

Hughes said: “This is the year for becoming more operationally efficient. As the channel, we need to train our thinking on the cost of doing business, not just the cost of buying services, because reductions here will be where the growth comes from. If you can streamline your business from transaction to delivery, you’ll naturally get growth not just through existing customers, but also for future prospects.”

Tickle advised: “Focus on partnerships that offer flexibility, transparency and long-term value. Growth isn’t about chasing volume, it’s about building trust and delivering consistently excellent service. Align with providers that understand your customer’s challenges and can help them to innovate.”

Mora also advocates for resellers to evaluate their existing vendor relationships. He said: “The market has changed, and people have changed, so as technology specialists, resellers should be looking all the time to see what other products and services are available, benchmarking themselves against their competition, and seeing how they can improve their customers journey through the technology minefield.”"

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/industry-news/morey-pledges-give-partners-edge,03-07-2025,Morey pledges to give partners an Edge,"With almost 30 years experience in the tech industry under his belt Will Morey took the reins as Gamma Business Managing Director in May this year. Here, he discusses his motivations and strategy, how he intends to drive deeper relationships with partners, and why the launch of Gamma Edge could be a game changer in channel support.

Why did you take the role of Gamma Business MD?

This is a role that brings together everything I care about... real people, a trusted solution set and a channel I’ve been part of for decades. I’ve worked closely with many of our partners over the years, and I saw this as an opportunity to build on that and help shape the next phase of growth together.

What strengths do you bring to the position?

I’ve spent my whole career in this industry, from running large distributor teams to co-founding businesses and growing them from scratch. That experience has given me perspective. I understand the pressures partners face and how to help them respond. I’m collaborative and focused on long-term impact, not just short-term wins.

What was your first priority as MD?

To listen. The best plans come from understanding what’s working and where the gaps are. That meant having open conversations with partners and teams, and using what we heard to shape a response that’s practical and genuinely helpful.

What changes are you making, and how will you make your mark?

We’re aligning more closely with how partners want to work. That means clearer growth planning, easier access to the full Gamma portfolio and smarter commercial support. I want partners to feel that Gamma is not just backing their growth but actively enabling it every step of the way.

How did H1 this year shape up for Gamma Business?

In 2024, both the group and Gamma Business continued to grow strongly driven primarily by our UCaaS portfolio. So far in 2025, we’re seeing strong momentum. The real growth is coming from partners who are engaging across the portfolio and using the full Gamma offer to build smarter, more resilient propositions for their customers.

What are your short and long-term priorities?

Right now, it’s about delivery. We’ve created a more joined-up partner experience and now we’re rolling it out with energy and focus. Looking ahead, we have many exciting plans for our partners to shift to higher-value, recurring revenue models that support their long-term performance. That’s why we introduced Gamma Edge, the most complete support framework we have ever launched, designed to help partners grow smarter, sell more and create lasting value with their customers. It’s a platform that brings together everything a partner needs to succeed in one connected place.

How did Gamma Edge come about?

We did not build Edge in a boardroom. We built it by listening. Over the past six months and beyond we have spent time with our partners across the country, asking honest questions and hearing real answers about what is working, what is not and where we can do better together. Those conversations have shaped everything about Gamma Edge, from the insight we provide to the commercial tools and support available.

How is Gamma Edge structured?

There are five components. ‘Partner Pulse’ is where we start, with joint business planning that’s genuinely co-created. No two partners are the same. It’s about tailoring Gamma’s approach to each and every partner.

‘Velocity’ turns that plan into reward. It’s a simplified rebate engine that recognises performance across the entire Gamma portfolio – UCaaS, connectivity, mobile and security. The more a partner grows with us, the more they earn. We’ve designed it to be transparent and scalable. ‘Elements’ gives parters the tools to deliver, and ‘Boost’ adds momentum. These are ready-to-go commercial accelerators created to help partners win faster.

‘Migrate’ helps partners protect and future-proof their base. It combines platform risk analysis with tools to move customers away from legacy estates, securely, smoothly and with full support. Migrate is about reducing churn and simplifying the transition to modern platforms.

Where do you see the Gamma channel in three years?

I want our partners to be more confident, more profitable and better supported. That means helping them grow faster, reduce risk and deepen their customer relationships all with a simpler, more scalable Gamma experience behind them. I’m confident that will happen.

Which market trends are shaping your thinking?

We’re seeing real demand for simplicity, value and trust. Customers want fewer suppliers and more dependable outcomes. For partners, that means making smart choices about what to sell and who to sell it with. That’s exactly where we want Gamma to deliver.

What excites you most tech-wise?

AI and automation have huge potential, especially when they drive partner productivity and customer experience. But we’re also focused on making everyday adoption easier, packaging services better, embedding security by design and making it simpler to sell and support the full stack.

Your proudest achievement?

I’m proud of what we built at Pragma and EnableX, but what means the most to me are the relationships that have stood the test of time. Trust is the currency of this industry. Being the person someone still calls for advice or opportunity ten years later, that’s the real win.

What would you change about the industry?

I’d take out the complexity. There are way too many people who speak ‘tech’. Acronyms and techy words kill conversations with customers. We’ve also created layers that don’t always add value. What partners and customers want is clarity, flexibility and services that just work, and that’s what we need to focus on.

Today’s top leadership priorities?

Strong relationships. Also, listen deeply and invest in people and partnerships. The strongest leaders remove friction and build confidence. It’s not about having all the answers – it’s about being reliable, relevant, and ready to deliver."

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/technology/virgin-media-o2-business-calls-msps-reduce-tech-burden-smes,26-06-2025,Virgin Media O2 Business calls on MSPs to reduce tech burden for SMEs,"New research from Virgin Media O2 Business reveals small and medium sized enterprise (SME) directors are experiencing more stress from technology, which is taking a significant toll on leaders’ mental health as a result.

The research of 2,000 small business owners, founders, MDs, and CEOs commissioned by Virgin Media O2 Business in support of World Wellbeing Week (24th – 30th June) highlights the impact of tech-related worries and multiple role responsibilities on SME leaders.

Tech-related stresses directly correlate to wellbeing declines affect 89%, with one-in-three (33%) SME leaders losing sleep at night over tech worries – and cybersecurity threats, data breaches, system crashes and technical failures are all cited as causes of significant stress (79%).

Knowing the importance of unlocking technology benefits for SMEs, Virgin Media O2 Business has called on the SME community to share the tech load.

Alongside this support, MSP and resellers can also help SMEs, stepping up to allow businesses focus on key issues.

Other research findings showed that leaders also spend an average of 10 hours per working week on tasks outside of their expertise, and for the one in two (54%) SME leaders having to spend more time on unfamiliar tasks than those they’re trained for, the pressure to wear multiple hats is taking its toll.

The added workload is negatively affecting business owners and directors, with 76% saying it impacts their wellbeing, and 51% saying they are more stressed now compared to when they started their business.

To combat this rise in added workload, and to support SME leaders in finding the right solutions for their companies, Virgin Media has a technical advisory team with specialists in unified communications, WiFi solutions, data centre operations, cloud technologies, and cybersecurity, on hand to give expert advice and guidance.

This will help them make informed choices on the solutions that best fit their unique business needs, allowing leaders to focus on other priorities while alleviating tech stress.

Ross Pearson, Head of Small Enterprise at Virgin Media O2 Business (pictured) commented: “Virgin Media O2 Business is here to act as a partner, not just a supplier for SMEs. We work with each customer to alleviate their tech stresses, acting as the tech experts so SME leaders can focus on taking the next step in their growth.”"

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/cybersecurity/bt-report-reveals-uk-smes-lack-skills-prevent-cyber-attacks,24-06-2025,BT report reveals UK SMEs lack skills to prevent cyber attacks,"Two in five – nearly 40% - of SMEs have not arranged cyber training for their teams, according to a new study by BT, costing companies considerable time and money to recover from an attack.

The research by BT, in partnership with Be the Business, also reveals four in ten (42%) small businesses having experienced a cyber-attack in the last 12 months, increasing to two in three (67%) for medium-sized companies.

The average cost of the most disruptive security breach for micro or small businesses is around £7,960, and can take months to recover from the resulting damage, yet most could be thwarted by cyber security tools costing just a few pounds a month.

The most common attack SMEs face is phishing, with email scams targeting 85% of UK businesses. Damaging ransomware incidents, meanwhile, have more than doubled in the last 12 months, rising from affecting less than 1 in 200 businesses last year to 1 in 100 in 2025.

A separate report by BT has revealed large businesses which are more proactive with their cyber security are more likely to grow that those who aren’t, and that these “cyber agile” companies have a 20% higher growth rate on average.

In response, BT is launching dedicated security training to help SMEs understand the practical steps they can take to protect themselves against cyber-attacks and potential breaches.

It will also educate small businesses about next-generation threats, including the role of AI and quantum computing, alongside highlighting the rise of attacks, including account takeovers where stolen customer credentials are used to breach systems, as well as QR code scams which have surged by 1,400% in the past five years.

Tris Morgan, Managing Director for Security at BT (pictured) commented: “For SMEs, a cyber-attack isn't just an inconvenience; it poses an existential threat. The good news is that effective cyber security can incorporate the right training, basic security measures, and awareness to help SMEs reduce their risk profile.”"
Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/trends/westcon-comstor-shares-channel-drivers-mark-40-years,24-06-2025,Westcon-Comstor shares channel drivers to mark 40 years,"Westcon-Comstor is marking its 40th birthday by sharing several industry trends that will shape its focus in the coming months and years as it vows to help establish a future-ready IT channel.

The distributor has published the channel trends as part of the introduction of its Future Ready project, which will enable channel partners to stay ahead of rapid technological change and growing market dynamics.

The key trends identified as driving the growth and transformation of the channel include how MSPs and specialised partners are emerging as hybrid's real winners, succeeding by building and selling services that allow them to own the ‘glue’ layer spanning automation, security, governance and data flow between platforms.

Other trends identified see cybersecurity as a business function, not just an IT concern, and the most effective channel partners will help align security with enterprise priorities.

Elsewhere, AI-driven data orchestration is redefining the role of the channel and the successful partners will be those who master the intersection of AI models, data governance and multi-environment orchestration.

Similarly, the company believes success in the cloud era requires new motions, new models and new skills and the key to success is to view hyperscalers as platforms, not suppliers or rivals.

The company also says that AI Is forcing a network rethink, and the channel holds the blueprint, and successful partners will be those who can design networks that think, heal and secure themselves.

Finally, the SMB digital wave is the channel’s next global growth engine, and Westcon believes that channel partners who deliver repeatable, scalable and automated solutions will unlock a margin-rich opportunity.

The distributor will be exploring these trends in more detail as part of its Future Ready programme through research, interviews with partners and vendors and insights from channel leaders.

David Grant, CEO at Westcon-Comstor (pictured) said: “Our Future Ready initiative will allow us to spotlight our heritage along with our forward-facing priorities and our dedication to enabling sustainable, long-term success across the channel.”"
Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/channel-products/kaseya-offers-extended-trials-msps,23-06-2025,Kaseya offers extended trials for MSPs,"Kaseya is rolling out a long-awaited demonstration programme, giving partners extended access to test new products before making licensing commitments.

The move, confirmed during the company’s flagship DattoCon Europe event in Dublin, marks a notable shift in its go-to-market approach and responds to demands from its MSP community to improve transparency, onboarding and customer support.

Historically, Kaseya partners were often required to license new tools without meaningful trial opportunities—an approach that some in the channel say has stifled confidence and adoption. “It was something that came up in discussion with Kaseya CEO Rania Succar (pictured),” said one UK-based partner at the event. “It was made clear that this would be extended to more products during the year —and it’s long overdue.”

Speaking to Comms Dealer sister firm IT Europa in Dublin, Kaseya CPO Jim Lippie confirmed the new initiative is being driven in direct response to partner feedback. “It’s a big piece of it,” he said. “People need the opportunity to properly evaluate these products. When they feel good about them, they will sign up.”

Lippie – who co-founded SaaS Alerts before joining Kaseya— – argued that rushed commitments often led to dissatisfaction: “If they buy it when they haven't fully evaluated it, and they sign a one or three year term, all they're going to be is upset. And that just creates negative feelings. It’s bad all the way around.”

He added that while some products already support limited trials, the new approach will expand coverage over time. “We’ve got 42 products… so you just can't wave a wand and change everything at once. But one thing you can do is be more flexible—and more partner-centric. That’s the overarching philosophy here now.”

When asked about the structure of the new programme, Lippie acknowledged that it remains ad hoc for some product lines. “You will have to talk to a salesperson in some cases, and we can set up a free trial… I would categorise that piece of it as ad hoc, because it's not formalised. But again, all things we're going to be working towards.”

He confirmed that around five or six products are already included in the scheme, covering security, management, and reporting tools. While not yet extending to storage offerings—“to test storage, you have to put stuff in”—he said the roadmap includes bringing even the more complex VSA and backup products into trial mode. “We’re working on making trials more accessible,” he said.

The programme was one of several new initiatives designed to boost partner success under the leadership of Succar, who took on the role just weeks before the Dublin event.

In her keynote, Succar acknowledged the need to address concerns around support and product maturity: “Many of you have shared with me that you'd like to see us increase our investment in product, improving product quality and improving the integration benefits of the platform.”

She added: “You've shared that you'd like to see us become more customer-centric. That's exactly what you'll see in the next chapter of Kaseya.”

Succar outlined four new corporate values—prioritising customer outcomes, delivering meaningful innovation, enhancing the end-to-end experience, and building stronger community collaboration. “We'll measure our success based on your success—revenue growth, profitability improvement, the impact you're able to deliver to your end customers. Those will be our North Stars.”

The trial programme follows a broader uptick in engagement, according to multiple partners. “There has been an improvement, but it's still sluggish,” one said. “We’ve been told that these delays are something they want to address.”

Succar appeared to acknowledge the issue directly: “When we commit to doing something, we're going to deliver it on time,” she said. “We’re going to raise the bar in every experience you have with us—from billing to support to onboarding to product reliability.”

Kaseya also pledged to ramp up its European presence, which Succar described as its fastest-growing region. “We’re increasing our investment across Europe by hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming years,” she said. “We’re going to invest in engineers locally. We’re going to invest in local data centres and partner enablement.”

With DattoCon Europe 2025 hosting over 1,500 MSPs and technology vendors, Kaseya used the event to showcase new features across its unified platform—including AI-driven automation tools designed to simplify repetitive tasks and strengthen integration across its portfolio.

Succar concluded with a promise to maintain focus on delivery and accountability: “We're going to continue working to earn your trust every day by driving meaningful innovation, exceptional customer experiences, and working to deliver outcomes for you and your end customers.”"

With the process complete, Jarlath Finnegan, Group CEO, and Graham McGregor, Group CFO, are departing, as leadership at group level is no longer seen as a requirement.

Ronan Kelly, previously APFN CTO, has been appointed APFN MD and Nisreen El-Kaloush, previously Commercial Director, has been appointed CCO.

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/ma-finance-acquisition/industry-ma-set-h2-uptick-drivers-intensify,18-06-2025,Industry M&A set for H2 uptick as drivers intensify,"Channel M&A is on an upward trajectory, driven by a key trend in particular that's intensifying, according to Knight Corporate Finance Director Paul Billingham.

""Across the market we have seen a downturn in deal activity, but our view is that the quality threshold for completed deals has been higher rather than acquirers pulling out of the market,"" he said. ""While the climate has been challenging over the last 12 months we have still seen good activity.""

As well as raising the deal quality bar – rather than a dip in the number of active acquirers – another important factor is behind growing M&A momentum, noted Billingham who cited recent research conducted by Knight Corporate Finance.

""Buy and build is often associated with acquiring a company and slashing costs to increase profit, but our survey says that this is not the case,"" he explained.

""As the lines across different reseller channels blur, it is important for buyers to be competitive and acquiring new skills has been key in ensuring they can remain relevant to customers.""

Billingham noted that Knight has had a good year, having completed 17 deals in the last 12 months. And he says there is a high level of underlying confidence from acquirers in the comms and IT sectors, despite a relatively quiet start to 2025 for M&A.

""A combination of economic uncertainty, interest rates and higher taxation has resulted in a fall in deal volumes with the first quarter of the year recording the lowest number of deals for three years,"" he added.

""However, our research of over 30 buyers from across the MSP, communications and cloud services sector indicates that confidence remains strong with M&A still high on the agenda.""

Research into the acquisition criteria for buyers revealed another telling trend, that building scale remains key with 24 per cent ranking increasing EBITDA as the most important factor.

""However, it is clear that acquiring for growth is proving more important than cost savings with 62 per cent of buyers citing organic growth, securing a position in a vertical market or expertise in a new technology as their main driver for a deal,"" added Billingham.

""Organic growth is the ultimate key value driver and ensuring teams have the right customer proposition is key to achieving this. It was also interesting and positive to note that 21 per cent of buyers told us that the quality of people was a key driver for making an acquisition.”

The research report went on to show that 77 per cent of the buyers questioned had completed at least one deal in the last year. Ninety three per cent were looking to complete an acquisition over the next 12 months, with 70 per cent seeking to close multiple deals.

Furthermore, 83 per cent had debt facilities and/or sufficient cash to fund their deals. And 86 per cent are actively searching for the right acquisition.

""The remainder showed an intent to acquire but on a more opportunistic basis,"" added Billingham. “We are talking to buyers, funders and private equity investors on a daily basis and know that there is a strong appetite for M&A.”

Knight Corporate Finance and sister company K3 Advantage are inviting MSP leaders to attend their Financial Sector M&A updates on July 8th, at London or Manchester (as part of UK Partner Week on July 3rd-10th organised by Comms Dealer publisher BPL Business Media).

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/industry-news/vodafonethree-details-post-merger-plans,13-06-2025,VodafoneThree details post-merger plans,"Alongside the previously announced £11bn investment into the UK’s 5G infrastructure, VodafoneThree has shared more information on its post-merger roadmap, with work already underway to integrate the Three and Vodafone networks into one entity.

The new company will operate a multi-brand mobile strategy in consumer with Vodafone, Three, VOXI, SMARTY and Talkmobile remaining. Vodafone will be the only brand for business customers.

Over the next 12 months, VodafoneThree will bring Three’s mobile broadband (Fixed Wireless Access1) together with Vodafone’s full fibre into one home broadband portfolio, under the Vodafone brand.

VodafoneThree, plans to reach 99.95% 5G Standalone (5G SA) population coverage by 2034. The 5G SA build plan will be front-loaded so that by the end of the third year it will hit 90% population coverage from a current baseline of 47%.

It states that in one year, up to 50 million people will have access to VodafoneThree’s fastest 5G speeds.

Within two weeks, through the sharing of combined spectrum, seven million Three and SMARTY customers will receive a 4G boost of up to 20%.

Within a few months, 27 million Vodafone and Three mobile customers will start to benefit from access to roam on each other’s networks at no extra cost. It will happen automatically. By the end of the year this will remove a total of 16,500 sq/km of not spots with the first sites already having been turned on.

By this time next year, VodafoneThree will launch beta trials on space-based satellite mobile network through Vodafone’s partnership with AST Space Mobile.

Within two years the company will open two new customer care centres in Belfast and Sheffield, bringing 400 sales and customer service roles back to the UK, alongside the existing call centres in Stoke and Glasgow.

VodafoneThree states that the deployment of 5G SA will lead to thousands more jobs in engineering, construction, and maintenance of telecom towers, fibre optics, and base stations. Over the entire eight-year build period, it believes it will create and sustain demand for, on average, 9,000 jobs, with peak investment years seeing as many as 13,000 jobs created across the UK (74% outside London and the south east).

By consolidating networks, VodafoneThree’s energy consumption will be around 31% lower than it would have been as two separate networks. In addition, VodafoneThree will reduce emissions from operations to net zero by 2027 and look to achieve the same across the full value chain by 2040.

Max Taylor, CEO, VodafoneThree: “A new era of connectivity has begun. We will connect every nation, every community, in every corner of the UK. We will build the UK’s best 5G network with an unprecedented £11bn privately funded infrastructure project, laying the digital foundation for our country’s growth ambitions.

“Benefits for our 27 million mobile customers will start within months, with access to roam across both networks at no extra cost. From big cities to small towns, and everywhere in between, our mission is to build the UK’s best network”."

The increase expands the total number of businesses available to partners from 80,000 and increases the density of serviceable businesses within its network footprint.

Andy Nash, Director, Business, Government and Mobile, CityFibre, told Comms Dealer: “The business market is a significant part of CityFibre’s success and has always punched above its weight in sense of revenue contribution, even with a smaller footprint.

""That is testament to our channel partner’s commitment to working with us and we know the single biggest advantage that we can provide them with is scale. This has been reflected in the last five years with the increase in our consumer footprint but we are now investing heavily to ensure that where we do roll out infrastructure, we connect all of the businesses that are available across that footprint.”

CityFibre’s expansion is underpinned by its nationwide 10Gb XGS-PON technology upgrade, being rolled out across its FTTP network. The rollout incorporates Business Ethernet platform, designed to bring CityFibre’s full FTTP network online for its Business ISPs.

Nash shared that CityFibre aims to address 800,000 business premises in total. “We are in the trajectory for that target,” he said. “We have opportunities to scale our business footprint through organic infill by winning central government and BDUK contracts as well as adding an inorganic contribution through mergers and acquisitions.”

In the past year, CityFibre has worked with its partners to speed-up the installation of new business Ethernet connections by up to 40%.

CityFibre seeks to drive market appetite by taking more of a partnership approach than would be seen on the consumer side, to ensure end-customers get connected. He said: “Our priority is to ensure that all our partners are underpinned with bespoke marketing campaigns and strategies that really commercialise the new footprint. From this base we will begin to innovate around the platform.”

To aid this, CityFibre has created a specialised business unit around its non-consumer verticals; business, government and mobile. Nash added: “These verticals require a special attention as the propositions and the solutioning is very different to what we do in the consumer space.

“Developing that organisational rap around a discrete business unit is a key focus for us going forward.”"

Comms Dealer,https://www.comms-dealer.com/sponsored-content/more-voice,03-06-2025,More Than Voice,"Vendors are adding AI, video, SMS, CX and so much more to their UCaaS offering. Boil that down and that means voice is just one component. Stop focusing on just voice!

The ROI for UCaaS comes from the many components that a unified offering can replace like video conferencing, audio bridge, team chat, file share, and so much more. To really sell the value of Unified Comms, we need to break away from selling voice replacement.

The first word is Unified. The whole idea behind that was efficiency in having a single pane of glass for many forms of communications. Customer Experience and omni-channel take that to another level. Being able to see WhatsApp, social media, texts and more in a single window is the holy grail for very small businesses who have to have their coordinator work with six apps open all day. Now it can all flow to one window to make it efficient. This means we are affording the customer of time savings in minutes every day.

These are talking points to have with prospects and customers. Most customers may not know about the added functionality since they signed on. Most businesses have employee turn-over so the employees may be unaware of the many advantages of your service offering. Education is a vital part of sales and retention. We have to remember that what we are really selling is a Software Platform – and the myriad capabilities that flow from that. It is a full stack of software that includes voice, but goes far beyond that.

Because it is software, it can integrate with other software. These software integrations have increasingly improved and with AI will become an even bigger driver of productivity for many workers. Inputting data once and having it available across the workflow is a dream for workers.

Sellers normally forget to ask the buyer about software being used in the business. The discussion typically is around the voice and PBX. Those are table stakes of commodity sales. Helping a business leverage the many aspects of the platform to propel the digital transformation of the business moves the sales rep from a sales rep to a business advisor. That’s where the magic happens.

Telling stories of how similar businesses took advantage of the platform will allow the buyer to see the possibility AND take a step away from PBX replacement. Remember that a key system buyer hasn’t shopped in over five years and the capabilities available to a small business now for $20 per user were unaffordable and unfathomable.

Many sales reps even forget to discuss the mobility piece of UCaaS. Work from Anywhere is still a viable business strategy. Businesses – even small ones – have many employees who are not just remote but mobile or at least on the move. Having a mobile friendly platform to stay in the know and on top of things is one more productivity point to make.

It is really easy to get caught up in PBX and voice replacement in the sales process, but we are the experts on this software platform. Our job is to educate the buyer on the many ways that this software can enhance his business and improve productivity for the workers.

During the sales process, you can have a discussion about the value of the platform and the outcomes that other businesses have derived from it or you can talk about the commodity component (voice), lower the price and hope for the best.

It is urging the two million vulnerable people who rely on lifesaving telecare alarms to contact landline providers for additional support during the switch.

During the process landline companies will send an engineer to carry out the switchover and personally test the telecare alarm, ensuring it continues to work once a household has moved onto the digital network.

Landline providers will also offer vulnerable customers a free battery back-up device so their landline can continue working in an outage.

This comes at the same time BT and Virgin Media O2, in collaboration with the UK Government, have launched a UK-wide campaign to support the same vulnerable users, amid 45% rise in landline faults.

Telecoms Minister Sir Chris Bryant said: “We cannot afford to leave anyone behind during the vital transition to digital landlines.

“I have personally set a strict checklist of safeguards for industry to comply with before they migrate any telecare user. This industry-led campaign marks a further step towards keeping people safe as we boost the resilience of our networks for the digital age.”"
