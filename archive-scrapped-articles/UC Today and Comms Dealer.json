        "title": "Hybrid Hype or Hard Reality? Why IT Leaders Must Rethink Collaboration Strategy Now",
        "cleaned_text": "With employees working across offices, homes, and even during transit – IT leaders face unprecedented challenges.\n\nAs hybrid work cements itself as the default model and not a temporary trend, leaders must rethink how they deliver seamless collaboration across varied environments, devices, and user expectations that can span multiple platforms, geographies, and use cases.\n\n“The shift to the hybrid work has fundamentally transformed the way the collaboration happens,” says Vivek Kar, Head of Employee Interaction Suite at Tata Communications.\n\n“Employees also work during transit where the connectivity could be an issue.”\n\nThis demands a fresh approach to how IT delivers seamless, secure, and reliable communication experiences across conditions – from traditional office and home environments to any location with variable connectivity.\n\nAccording to IDC, 93 percent of enterprises now use UC&C applications like video conferencing, team messaging, and screen sharing, highlighting how hybrid collaboration has evolved into a mature, enterprise-wide capability rather than a stopgap pandemic solution.\n\nIT teams must now ensure consistent voice, video, messaging, and file-sharing experiences – even under unstable network conditions.\n\nMeeting this challenge requires flexible solutions that work across devices, time zones, and connection qualities.\n\nMulti-Platform Complexity: Flexibility vs. Manageability\n\nA major hurdle is the reality of multiple UC platforms within the same organization.\n\nOften a result of mergers, legacy systems, or regional preferences, this multi-platform environment creates complexity for IT teams.\n\nHowever, managing disparate platforms can lead to fragmented user experiences, security vulnerabilities, and increased operational overhead.\n\nA 2024 survey by Metrigy found that 51 percent of organizations consider consolidating UC&C platforms extremely important, with another 24 percent calling it somewhat important.\n\n“Employees, partners and customers often operate across different UC platforms,” said Kar.\n\n“Supporting multiple platforms preserves the user choices and the business agility.”\n\nEmpowering Users: Scaling Without Overburdening IT\n\nCentral IT teams can easily become overwhelmed managing routine tasks like user onboarding, troubleshooting, and configuration especially in complex multi-platform environments. Kar stresses the importance of decentralizing these tasks:\n\n“User-self service is a foundational element for scalability… IT teams can’t be the bottleneck for routine actions like onboarding, troubleshooting, or configuration.”\n\nBy enabling local administrators and end-users with intuitive tools and APIs, organizations can reduce IT workload and accelerate response times.\n\nThis shift not only improves efficiency but also enhances user satisfaction by putting control closer to the point of need.\n\nManaged Services: The Strategic Future\n\nWith multi-platform collaboration becoming the norm, managed services will need to evolve beyond basic support into strategic partners that provide orchestration, AI-powered analytics, and unified governance.\n\nAccording to Nemertes Research, 27 percent of enterprises now rank managed services availability among their top three UC&C provider selection criteria, signaling growing expectations for scalable, hands-off support capabilities.\n\n“Managed services will become central to driving faster adoption, optimizing collaboration ROI, and fostering continuous improvement,” Kar predicted.\n\nFor IT leaders, this means reconsidering vendor relationships and exploring service providers capable of delivering cross-platform management, security compliance, and lifecycle support – critical components to keep pace with evolving collaboration demands.\n\nNavigating the Challenges Ahead\n\nThe road ahead is filled with difficult trade-offs.\n\nSingle-vendor platforms offer simplicity and streamlined security but risk limiting innovation and user choice. Conversely, multi-platform approaches maximize flexibility but increase complexity and cost.\n\nKar’s advice underscores the need for a holistic strategy:\n\n“Hybrid work isn’t a passing phase. It is the new operating model. Success will depend not just on choosing the right platforms, but on how well those platforms work together, adapt to users, and scale with the business.”\n\nInvesting in integration, empowering users through self-service, and partnering with managed services providers that offer orchestration and AI-driven insights will be critical for enterprises to thrive in this hybrid era."

        "title": "Google Meet’s Automatic Room Check-In with Ultrasound Detection Elevates Collaboration",
        "cleaned_text": "Google Meet has potentially made hybrid meetings a little smarter and a lot smoother.\n\nIts latest update introduces automatic room check-in via proximity detection. It uses ultrasonic signals to quietly sort out one of the most irritating aspects of modern collaboration: joining a meeting the right way, in the right room, without creating an echo chamber.\n\nBut beyond the tech’s slickness, there’s a deeper signal for enterprise IT, UC, and workplace leaders in that the age of context-aware collaboration is picking up speed.\n\nA Smarter, Smoother Way to Join Meetings\n\nAvailable now, Google Meet’s new automatic check-in feature uses proximity detection to do something deceptively clever. If you’re using Companion mode on your laptop within a meeting room equipped with certified Google Meet hardware, your device will now detect an ultrasonic signal from the room system and take the hint.\n\nBefore you even click “Join”, Google Meet highlights the Companion mode option, steering you away from audio feedback disasters and toward a cleaner, echo-free experience. Once you join, it automatically checks you into the correct room. If Dynamic Tiles are enabled, it may also prompt you to confirm your face via Face Match, so your name appears instead of the room’s.\n\nThis is a small but subtly significant improvement to the meeting join experience, one of those high-impact UX details that reduces friction at scale. The functionality is available only on Chrome via the Meet web app, and is currently limited to the green room (the interface before joining a call) and a brief period after Companion mode begins. Google recommends sticking with certified Meet hardware, as third-party devices may not deliver consistent results.\n\nAdmins get full control, of course. Proximity detection is enabled by default, but can be fine-tuned or switched off entirely on a per-device basis from the Admin console. That means organisations with stricter security, privacy, or device management policies can adapt the feature to their own needs.\n\nWhy the C-Suite and IT Leaders Should Take Note\n\nOn one level, this is a neat trick that reduces collaboration friction. But, viewed through a more ambitious lens, it also teases the future as a window into the next evolution of unified communications, one where platforms anticipate context, simplify choices, and actively prevent the kinds of mistakes that waste time and erode productivity.\n\nThis is good news for IT and UC teams. There will be fewer “how do I join this call?” helpdesk tickets and fewer moments of embarrassment as someone accidentally joins a meeting from their laptop and the room system simultaneously. This will likely result in fewer delays while someone figures out which button to press. It’s small stuff until you multiply it across hundreds of rooms and thousands of users every single day.\n\nThis illustrates a broader change for CIOs, CTOs, and workplace strategy leaders, moving away from reactive collaboration infrastructure to intelligent, proactive environments. Using sensors, audio cues, and automation, Google’s investment in context-aware UX is quietly transforming how people interact with tech in shared spaces. It’s intended to make the smart meeting room truly smart.\n\nFrom a procurement angle, there’s something else going on here. By leaning into the benefits of a tightly integrated hardware-software ecosystem, Google is staking a claim in the enterprise UCaaS arms race. It’s not just about who has the best call quality or the most integrations anymore, but who can make the experience seamless, scalable, and invisible to the user.\n\nThat puts pressure on rivals. Organisations considering Microsoft Teams Rooms, Zoom Rooms, or Cisco devices now must ask: Can our meeting platform think for itself?\n\nGoogle Meet’s Note Taker Gets an Update: How It Reduces the Need for Third-Party AI\n\nIn a quieter, but equally impactful, move, Google also supercharged its “Take Notes for Me” feature in Google Meet last month, making post-meeting intelligence more accessible and immediate.\n\nUntil now, users received a link to a Google Doc after their meeting wrapped up, requiring yet another click and context switch just to see what was discussed. With this latest update, Google is doing away with that extra step. The meeting summary and suggested next actions are now embedded directly in the recap email, resulting in no detours and no digging.\n\nIt’s a small change on the surface, but it tightens the feedback loop and keeps momentum flowing between meetings. For busy professionals juggling back-to-backs, this new embedded experience reduces friction and makes it easier to act on insights without interrupting their workflow.\n\nTaken together with the new proximity-based check-in, Google Meet is becoming sharper, more helpful, and more seamlessly integrated into the rhythms of enterprise life."

        "cleaned_text": "AT&T has announced the expansion of its Office@Hand unified communications platform through an extension of its 10-year partnership with RingCentral, incorporating RingCentral’s RingCX contact center technology.\n\nThis integration adds advanced AI-powered omnichannel contact center capabilities to AT&T’s existing UCaaS offerings. The enhanced Office@Hand service will be available to AT&T business customers across the US, aiming to improve customer interaction management and employee productivity through a single, cloud-based platform.\n\n“By expanding our decade-long partnership with RingCentral, we are able to bring contact center and conversational intelligence functionality to our portfolio,”\n\nJoe Petrocelli, VP of Communications Services, AT&T Business, said.\n\nThis announcement fits into a wider industry pattern where service providers are increasingly turning to RingCentral’s technology to underpin their own UC and CC solutions.\n\nDigging into the Details of AT&T–RingCX\n\nThe expanded solution leverages AT&T’s extensive network infrastructure combined with RingCX’s cloud-native contact center platform, which supports voice, video, chat, SMS, and over 20 digital channels.\n\nThis allows businesses of all sizes to unify their communications and customer support functions while benefiting from AI-driven tools such as real-time transcription, sentiment analysis, and agent coaching.\n\nThis seamless integration allows businesses to manage customer interactions across voice, SMS, chat, and popular digital channels from one platform.\n\n“By expanding Office@Hand Business Communication with RingCX Contact Center and RingSense AI functionalities, we’re delivering a unique platform, enhancing customer experiences, and empowering end-users to improve their core business,”\n\nHomayoun Razavi, EVP & GM, Global Strategic Partnerships at RingCentral, said.\n\nBy adopting RingCX technology, AT&T is accelerating time-to-market and enriching its Office@Hand brand with advanced AI capabilities that are increasingly demanded in customer service environments.\n\nBut it’s not just AT&T that is seeing the utility. BT, one of the UK’s biggest telcos, also approached RingCentral to implement RingCX into its CCaaS offering.\n\nRingCX Uncovered: Why Is It Cutting Through to Telcos?\n\nDigging into BT’s arrangement with RingCentral, similarities begin to emerge as to why the platform is proving popular among telcos.\n\nBoth exemplify how these larger companies leverage RingCX to broaden their UC and CC offerings to their own customers without having to build solutions themselves from scratch.\n\n“AT&T’s integration of RingCentral’s AI-powered contact center and conversational intelligence into Office@Hand delivers the comprehensive, AI-first customer experience platform enterprises are demanding,”\n\nDave Michels, principal analyst and founder of TalkingPointz, said.\n\n“This partnership demonstrates how service providers can differentiate through AI while reducing customer complexity and costs—creating a compelling value proposition for organizations modernizing their customer engagement strategy.”\n\nLike AT&T, RingCentral has a decade-long partnership with BT. This fact alone has helped give it a foot in the door, along with time to build partnerships and a solid understanding of the telco vertical and its needs.\n\nLike with AT&T, its integrated contact center solution Cloud Work RingCX combines the elements of the telco’s strength—in this case BT’s network security and fraud management resources—with RingCX’s omnichannel and AI-driven capabilities.\n\nFor both telcos, the ability to incorporate AI is also a big draw of using RingCX to offer differentiated, AI-powered UC and CC services under their own brands.\n\nThis white-label or embedded technology approach allows these firms to innovate rapidly and deliver value-added features while reducing platform development risks and costs.\n\nRingCX Dialing in to Telco Success\n\nThe strategic adoption of RingCX by multiple major telcos illustrates a broader shift in the UCaaS/CCaaS landscape toward platform-based partnerships and embedded technologies.\n\nCompanies want flexible, scalable, AI-powered solutions that they can confidently brand and deliver without building from scratch—a gap RingCX fills effectively.\n\nIts long history with telcos and its own status as a telephony company means it was well positioned to serve these companies.\n\nThat, plus its investment in AI and conversational analytics, combined with its cloud-native, API-rich platform, has positioned it as a silent engine powering a growing number of service provider UC/CC offerings.\n\nAs the demand for seamless, omnichannel, and AI-augmented communication experiences continues to climb, the role of foundational platforms like RingCX will only grow. The question is no longer why companies turn to RingCX, but how quickly competitors will respond with comparable embedded technology strategies."

        "title": "Phase Two for AI: Why Agent Augmentation Must Follow Automation in Contact Centers",
        "cleaned_text": "Contact centers, already no strangers to automation, have been some of the biggest wholesale adopters of the technology, with Gartner stating 85% of customer service leaders will explore or pilot customer-facing conversational AI in 2025.\n\nIndeed, AI’s use in contact centers has already been seminal. AI chatbots are now able to reduce agent demand by dealing with routine customer queries that would have previously had to be handled by an agent. It’s a win for efficiency, but it’s not without ramifications. This change in inquiry handling has created a domino effect for agents.\n\n“The nature of the calls that now come through a voice channel to human agents is much more complex,” Andreas Orebo Wenzel, VP of Engage AI at Jabra, said. “This has increased the demand on the calls and the agent.”\n\nThese incoming calls now often require deeper technical knowledge, emotional sensitivity, or decision-making finesse in order to satisfy customers.\n\nBut just as companies have invested heavily in AI to reduce human interaction, it’s now necessary to counterbalance this by deploying AI to assist the agents dealing with this new challenge.\n\nWhy AI Chatbots Make Human Jobs More Complex\n\nWith AI chatbots now solving more entry level issues, modern contact center agents are being asked to go more in-depth on each call to a weary customer who has already spent time trying to resolve their issue through the initial points of contact.\n\nThis creates a situation where they’re often expected to be the immediate solution to the issue, even if they’re just being introduced to the issue for the first time.\n\n“Call center agents are expected to be able to handle tough questions right on the spot, even if they don’t know what the next call is about,” Orebo Wenzel emphasized.\n\nOn top of this cognitive pressure, agents often work in noisy or distracting environments — either from home or busy offices. This persistent background noise, even if subtle, contributes to fatigue.\n\n“It can be very mentally draining,” Orebo Wenzel explained, “especially when you’re exposed to that through 6–8 hour shifts.”\n\nBut the challenges don’t stop there. Agents also have to juggle the associated administrative elements of the role — manual note-taking, CRM inputs, and multitasking — all while trying to sound composed and empathetic.\n\nAll these associated tasks and distractions make it increasingly difficult to efficiently resolve the customer’s reason for calling. This, in turn, could lead to unsatisfactory and slower resolutions — and an unhappy customer.\n\nRecognizing this, audio specialists Jabra have augmented their solutions to bring AI to assist contact center agents so they can save agent capacity for focusing on what really matters: the customer.\n\nHow Jabra’s Engage AI Complete Turns the Tide\n\nEngage AI Complete is a new premium tier of Jabra’s Engage AI software designed specifically for call centers. Its solution is tailored for the next chapter that contact center operations are entering.\n\nRather than replacing agents, it augments them with real-time support, data-driven coaching, and environmental optimization. First, it does this through two-way noise reduction. While Jabra’s headsets can cancel ambient noise on the agent’s side, Engage AI takes it further.\n\n“With our technology, we can reduce background noise on the customer end of the call,” Orebo Wenzel said.\n\nThis ensures clarity even when customers call from chaotic environments, increasing comprehension for the agent and reducing the strain they experience in trying to understand muffled customers.\n\nSecond, it brings automated transcription and note summarization to agents. Using advanced speech-to-text, Engage AI transcribes calls live — freeing agents from manual note-taking and post-call data entry.\n\nThis doesn’t just boost productivity by allowing agents to take more calls — it helps them stay mentally and emotionally present when on the phone with customers.\n\n“Instead of having to write down notes, you can leave that to the AI to do,” Orebo Wenzel explained.\n\nThird — and perhaps most compelling — is its tone-of-voice analysis. Engage AI functions like a virtual mirror in the agent’s corner, using a simple red-amber-green visual cue to show whether they sound empathetic, flat, or engaged. It even analyzes both sides of the call, allowing agents to mirror the emotional tone of the caller in real time to engage with a customer on their terms. Although seemingly superficial, tone matters more than companies realize.\n\n“You actually don’t remember what they said, but you very much remember how they made you feel,” Orebo Wenzel explained.\n\nThis solution becomes even more powerful when considering the offering it provides new hybrid work models many contact centers now operate under.\n\nAs supervisors can’t walk the floor the way they used to, Engage AI gives them contextual alerts about agent interactions when attention is needed. This allows contact center leaders to keep track of their team’s performance regardless of location, and coaching at scale without burning out supervisors or agents.\n\nThis implementation of AI at the agent level isn’t just an effort to reduce cognitive load — it’s a business case.\n\nJabra reports that when agents receive tone feedback and sound more engaged, calls become shorter and customer satisfaction rises.\n\n“If I sound more engaged and friendly, then the likelihood of you perceiving that as a better customer experience is higher,” Orebo Wenzel said.\n\nThese shorter calls don’t just help agents — they mean better queue management, reduced costs, faster customer engagement time and improved first-call resolution.\n\nThe Future of Human-AI Collaboration Starts Here\n\nAs companies like Klarna have begun reversing AI-only strategies after seeing dips in customer satisfaction, it’s clear that an AI-only approach cannot deliver better outcomes for contact centers.\n\nThus, the next phase of AI in contact centers won’t be defined by how well machines replace humans, but by how intelligently they support them.\n\nAs customers bring more emotionally charged, complicated issues to live agents, it’s not enough to simply answer quickly. Agents need to listen deeply, respond empathetically, and solve problems fast — all while managing growing cognitive demands.\n\nIn this context, solutions like Engage AI Complete offer the ability to pursue that same desire for efficiency without sacrificing the customer experience.\n\nIn an industry where experience is everything and turnover is high, equipping agents with smart, assistive AI isn’t just a tech trend, it’s increasingly a competitive necessity."

        "title": "Off-Channel Messaging: How to Stop Your Business Habit Becoming a Hacker’s Heaven",
        "cleaned_text": "Enterprise communication has changed dramatically over time. What began with emails since shifted to brief messages on platforms like Teams or Slack, and now again has changed so that much of it now takes place through employees’ personal instant messaging apps.\n\nWhether it’s WhatsApp, iMessage, WeChat, Telegram, or SMS, employees are increasingly using consumer messaging apps to communicate with clients, partners, and even colleagues.\n\nWhat began as a convenience during the early days of remote work, when each company was using different, and often incompatible UC software, has now become an entrenched part of daily workflows.\n\nAlthough interoperability between platforms has improved, the seamless capability people get from using WhatsApp to message customers and clients means the practice persists.\n\nHowever, by allowing staff to embrace this convenience, many businesses have unknowingly opened the door to serious security and compliance risks.\n\n“Messaging has become a frontline communication tool,” says Ari Applbaum, VP of Marketing at LeapXpert. “But the underlying infrastructure, the tools, the governance, even user behavior, is still rooted in legacy channels like email. That creates a massive exposure gap.”\n\nThat gap is being exploited. The use of WhatsApp is increasingly attracting hackers who know that vital business information is passing through it. As a result, adversaries are using it as their preferred point of entry.\n\nOnce breached, businesses face data leaks, regulatory violations, and reputational damage, often with no way to protect themselves.\n\nWhile most IT teams have built rigorous governance around email, very few have done the same for messaging. Attackers know this and are moving fast.\n\nHow Hackers Exploit the Messaging Gap\n\nAs messaging apps become business-critical tools, attackers target them as the path of least resistance. “Hackers have adapted quickly,” Applbaum explains. “They know businesses are messaging-first but security-second, that makes chat a soft target.”\n\nEqually, these attacks are augmented by AI to use increasingly sophisticated phishing that can accurately impersonate clients. Indeed, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, impersonation scams have soared 148% year-on-year, thanks in part to AI tools.\n\nEven small deviations in tone or punctuation can be AI-generated to mimic trusted senders. With WhatsApp messaging boasting a 98% open rate, and users treating chat messages with less scrutiny than email, phishing attempts are not only more believable but also sees increased engagement.\n\nOnce opened, a message might dupe the worker to clicking a link by claiming to be a client sharing a contract or a colleague requesting feedback on some work. Malware can then be loaded onto the worker’s phone, wreaking havoc.\n\nThis gives attackers access to all business-specific information discussed on that device: pricing, strategy, accounts, anything.\n\n“Mobile device management secures the device,” says Applbaum, “but it doesn’t secure message content. That’s a common misconception.” He adds that end-to-end encryption is not a silver bullet: “Encrypted in transit doesn’t mean safe. You must consider where data is stored, how it’s processed, and who controls the keys.”\n\nCompanies have no way to detect or stop these breaches because business data on off-channel messaging isn’t connected to corporate systems. Personal cloud backups, auto-sync, and private storage mean sensitive data can live and leak from unmanaged environments.\n\nThe risks from such an occurrence range from compliance failures to breaches that threaten customer trust and regulatory rules.\n\nSecure Messaging, Built for the Enterprise\n\nYou may think that one way of solving this challenge is to cease the use of off-channel messaging. Yet, that would prove futile and even a hindrance to valuable business being conducted on these channels.\n\nBut solving this requires more than adding security tools to existing apps; it demands rethinking messaging architecture.\n\nLeapXpert offers a system that meets employees where they are while giving IT full control.\n\n“Most tools were built for consumers and retrofitted for business,” Applbaum says.\n\n“We flipped that. LeapXpert was built for enterprise-grade control and compliance first, introducing a single professional identity, one number across channels, within corporate governance.”\n\nThis approach eliminates what Applbaum calls “comms chaos.” Instead of requiring employees to juggle multiple apps, numbers, and accounts, LeapXpert allows them to use the same identity whilst using their preferred method of communications, be it WhatsApp, SMS, or iMessage. Equally, because it is under this single identity, this places all of these conversations happening across these channels firmly under the company’s enterprise communication umbrella.\n\nConversations are captured and governed centrally, giving organizations full visibility without disrupting user experience.\n\nEqually, this overview companies get by unifying their communication channel enables real-time surveillance, metadata capture, and policy enforcement. Messages, even deleted or edited, are logged and archived per regulations, making compliance proactive.\n\nPlus, this solution doesn’t just help govern your data but protect it, too. One of LeapXpert’s standout innovations, designed to detect this new AI threat in messaging, can be deployed as part of this unifying system.\n\nPiloted with HSBC, this AI-powered impersonation detection engine analyzes how individuals typically communicate, down to word choice and punctuation, and flags deviations that could indicate fraud or spoofing.\n\nOnce you unify communications at the platform level, businesses no longer have to choose between productivity and security, they can have both.\n\nWhy Solving Messaging Security Can’t Wait\n\nOff-channel messaging is not a cultural issue to be fixed, it’s a vulnerability waiting to be secured. Every message sent outside IT’s visibility increases the risk of a breach, a regulatory fine, or a public incident that can cost a company its reputation overnight.\n\nAs Applbaum emphasizes, protecting data is just one part of the equation. Organizations are also safeguarding customer relationships, brand equity, and trust.\n\nApplbaum advises a clear risk assessment to address this: evaluate how employees communicate, where conversations are stored, and if channels meet regulatory standards. Then, move beyond reactive policies to secure-by-design platforms built on zero-trust, native APIs, and enterprise certifications.\n\nPlatforms must integrate with collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams to reduce friction, boost adoption, and maintain security without disrupting work. “If you want users to stick with a secure solution,” Applbaum says, “it has to fit how they already work.”\n\nFinally, scrutinize technology partners for security posture, audit trails, and adaptability to new threats. Messaging isn’t going away. But the gap between communication and protection must close and fast.\n\nMessaging isn’t going away, but the gap between communication and protection must close, and fast. Those who act now will avoid disaster, build resilience, and secure the competitive advantage that real-time messaging brings. Don’t let your business become a hacker’s heaven: take the first step towards secure, compliant communication today."

Collaboration Platform Infiltration: The group is actively infiltrating Microsoft Teams and Slack to gather internal intelligence, craft realistic phishing messages, and escalate privileges – all while blending in.\n\nCritical Steps IT Teams Must Take Now\n\nTo defend against the evolving tactics of Scattered Spider, IT teams must take immediate, strategic action across multiple layers of their security infrastructure.\n\nFirst, help desk protocols should be updated to include strict identity verification before resetting passwords or MFA tokens, along with call-back procedures for unusual requests and full logging of all credential-related interactions.\n\nMulti-factor authentication must also be hardened – replacing SMS-based MFA with phishing-resistant options like hardware security keys or biometric methods, and enabling features such as number matching and geolocation prompts to prevent accidental approvals.\n\nRemote access tools, which are frequently exploited by attackers, should be tightly controlled.\n\nThis means auditing all usage, restricting installation to approved applications, and setting up real-time alerts for tools like AnyDesk and TeamViewer.\n\nIn addition, internal communication platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Slack must be secured, with strong authentication requirements, restricted guest access, and ongoing monitoring for unusual behaviour – like messages from inactive accounts or logins from new locations.\n\nEmployees should also be trained to question unexpected requests, even when they appear to come from trusted internal sources.\n\nSince Scattered Spider has shown a keen interest in platforms like Snowflake, organisations should enforce role-based access controls, enable detailed activity logging, and monitor for anomalies like unusually large query volumes, implementing rate limiting where necessary.\n\nFinally, resilience against ransomware depends on strong recovery practices: IT teams should maintain encrypted, offline backups stored separately from production systems and conduct regular restoration drills to ensure they can bounce back quickly if an incident occurs.\n\nBottom Line: Assume You’re a Target\n\nScattered Spider isn’t just exploiting code – they’re exploiting people, habits, and trust.\n\nTheir techniques combine technical skill with psychological manipulation, targeting IT teams, help desks, and internal communication tools to gain a foothold.\n\nIn this landscape, technical defences alone are no longer enough. Organisations must embrace a zero-trust mindset, implement multi-layered access controls, and prioritize user training as a frontline defence strategy.\n\nEvery MFA prompt, every password reset request, and every Slack message is a potential attack vector.\n\nThe best defence is ultimately vigilance – built on clear processes, hardened systems, and a security-aware culture."

        "cleaned_text": "Microsoft has quietly rolled out enhanced audit logging capabilities for Teams meetings in a bid to strengthen IT teams’ auditability and observability.\n\nThe update captures comprehensive data about who initiates screen shares, when control is requested or granted, and which participants access shared content during meetings.\n\nThis represents another step for Microsoft Teams to meetings more secure by offering granular visibility over sharing and recording meeting content.\n\nUnderstanding the New Audit Logging Capabilities\n\nTeams has a system of audit logs that help IT teams keep an overview of user and admin actions like messages sent, files shared, user logins, team creation, and changes to settings.\n\nThe new enhanced audit logging system now adds to this log by capturing a comprehensive range of meeting activities that were previously invisible to administrators.\n\nFor instance, when participants share screens during Teams meetings, the system now records detailed metadata including participant identities, timestamps for share initiation and termination, and specific details about control transfer actions.\n\nEqually, this granular tracking extends to the use of “Take Control,” “Give Control,” and “Request Control” actions, providing a complete audit trail of who accessed what content, who initiated access, and when.\n\nThe new audit logs are accessible through Microsoft Purview or the Microsoft 365 compliance center, and make the logs searchable through familiar interfaces; administrators can filter logs using the “MeetingParticipantDetail” operation name or search for “screenShared” keywords to quickly identify relevant activities.\n\nThe system also supports date range filtering, enabling targeted investigations of specific time periods or incidents. Information from this portal can be exported as CSV files for further analysis.\n\nSuch a level of detail provides IT teams with unprecedented insight into how sensitive content flows through their organization’s virtual meetings.\n\nThis can not only help IT teams with auditability and compliance efforts by giving greater visibility into meetings but also aid in uncovering suspicious behavior that could be a sign of a security issue.\n\nThe Growing Threat Landscape\n\nMicrosoft’s recent update to Teams recognizes that the UC platform is increasingly being targeted, as hackers see it as a way to gain mission-critical information.\n\nFor instance, the Scattered Spider hacking group has been particularly active in exploiting Teams and similar collaboration platforms, using advanced social engineering techniques to manipulate employees and gain unauthorized access to corporate networks.\n\nThese attacks leverage the inherent trust users place in internal communication platforms, making them particularly dangerous and difficult to detect.\n\nOnce attackers establish a presence within Teams environments, they can gather intelligence about organizational structure, ongoing projects, and security practices.\n\nSuch tactics demonstrate that traditional security measures require reinforcement with more advanced monitoring and behavioral analytics.\n\nThus, the new capabilities to see who requested screen sharing can give additional clues to IT teams about users acting suspiciously and who need further investigation.\n\nThis particular focus on screen sharing seems to be of acute interest for Microsoft as they aim to make Teams more secure.\n\nLast month, the company announced it is introducing a screen capture prevention feature, which will black out meeting windows when participants attempt to take screenshots.\n\nEqually, participants joining a Teams call from unsupported platforms will be restricted to audio-only mode.\n\nThese technical controls further demonstrate that the tech titan sees its Teams meetings as a potential weak link for its customers.\n\nMaking Meetings More Secure\n\nThe introduction of advanced audit logging represents another incremental security improvement Microsoft is making to Teams and its meetings.\n\nWith these new audit tools, organizations can enhance their security posture by establishing baseline behavioral patterns for screen sharing and content access, enabling them to detect anomalies that might indicate security incidents or policy violations.\n\nEqually, with Microsoft coincidentally rolling out remote diagnostic capabilities that gets logs from users’ devices, and an update that enables transcription policies by default for new tenants, this tool can work as part of a holistic approach to examining user behavior.\n\nSuch intelligence can inform targeted training programs and policy adjustments to reduce security risks.\n\nEqually, such capabilities can prove particularly valuable for industries with strict compliance requirements, extending their level of auditability essential for regulatory compliance."

        "cleaned_text": "Uniti has officially swallowed Windstream, potentially moving the telecoms dial.\n\nAs of August 4, 2025, the two companies, once entangled exes after Uniti’s 2015 spin-off from Windstream, are now back under one roof, this time with Uniti calling the shots following a deal worth a reported $13.4 billion.\n\nOn paper, the deal makes sense. Uniti and Windstream have been codependent for years, sharing infrastructure, disputes, and lawyers. Now, the merger draws a firmer line under their shared past.\n\nThe merger, finalised this past week, sees both Windstream and “Legacy Uniti” become wholly owned subsidiaries of the new Uniti Group. Shareholders of the old Uniti received a conversion ratio of 0.6029 shares in the new entity, giving them a 62 percent controlling stake in the combined company. Convertible notes have been recalibrated, too, reflecting the updated equity structure.\n\nNext on the agenda: debt consolidation. Uniti plans to fold all existing liabilities, both its own and Windstream’s, into a single organisational silo, which should offer them financial clarity, operational simplicity, and investor confidence.\n\nHowever, beneath the corporate headlines lies a deeper undercurrent, and tech buyers can’t afford to ignore it.\n\nWhy This Matters to Tech Leaders, and What to Do About It\n\nFor CIOs, CTOs, IT directors, UC leads, and procurement teams, wariness and caution around this merger are understandable.\n\nWhen major telecom players merge, disruption tends to be a probability rather than a possibility. SLAs often get rewritten, support teams might get restructured, and account managers are sometimes reshuffled. Pricing models might be retooled. In the thick of it, the organisations that are the telecoms’ customers often find themselves confronting a suddenly unfamiliar scenario.\n\nThis might not necessarily happen following the Uniti/Windstream merger. The process could be seamless and harmonious, even result in a refined customer experience and product delivery. However, due diligence and proactive strategic planning never hurt anyone.\n\nIf your organisation uses Uniti or Windstream, directly or via a third-party provider, it might be advisable to get ahead of this. Now, reach out to your reps and ask the awkward questions. What changes are coming to service delivery? Are support processes shifting? Will your contracts be honoured or reinterpreted?\n\nEven if the answer is “no change”, don’t necessarily take it at face value. Mergers often create a vacuum of clarity in the short term, even if the long-term vision is rosy. IT and UC leaders should pressure-test their infrastructure. Do you have redundancy? Can you pivot if needed? Is your vendor risk strategy genuinely robust or fallible and outdated?\n\nDiversification, due diligence, and contractual agility are strategic imperatives. This is arguably the moment to interrogate your supplier stack, re-evaluate risk, and refine a contingency plan that doesn’t hinge on crossed fingers and legacy SLAs.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nThe Uniti-Windstream merger is a salient reminder that the infrastructure underpinning your business is in a constant state of flux. You’re gambling with continuity if you’re not actively managing that reality.\n\nFor IT, C-Suite, and UC leaders with skin in the game, this is your cue to review, reassess, and realign. When the telecom giants move, the aftershocks often hit everyone."

        "cleaned_text": "In an ideal world, managing communications compliance would be simple. Every company would follow the same rulebook, use the same tools, and mitigate the same threats. In the real world, the idea that a single security strategy can fit every industry is collapsing fast.\n\nCompanies can’t just build ecosystems that adapt to new threats like AI deepfakes and advanced spoofing mechanisms anymore. They need industry-specific compliance solutions tailored to their workflows. Sure, different companies might face similar threats, but the way they handle those hurdles needs to be more focused. Healthcare, finance, education, and government groups all have different rules to follow.\n\nHIPAA means encrypted video and patient logs, not just generic TLS. Finance requires immutable archives for SEC and FINRA; “record soft delete” isn’t acceptable. Schools must deal with FERPA and COPPA, adding requirements like parental consent for underage users.\n\nOne-size-fits-all platforms can’t always handle that complexity. Many companies now need something more fine-tuned, modular, context-aware architecture, like the systems powered by Netsapiens’ multi-tenant hosted PBX platform for service providers.\n\nHere’s why a solution layered with industry-specific controls is so valuable in today’s world.\n\nThe Rise of Multi-Tenant, Flexible Architecture\n\nWhen most people hear “multi-tenant,” they picture a single infrastructure hosting many customers. It’s great for sharing costs, speeding deployment, and scaling rapidly. In fact, multi-tenant strategies are so popular that some studies show that up to 94 percent of enterprise customers rely on them.\n\nBut sharing services also means sharing risks and limitations, if the architecture in question isn’t capable of being fine-tuned to the needs of each individual business. True multi-tenant systems require airtight data separation, strict access controls, and flexible resource policies for industry-specific compliance and continued uptime.\n\nA multi-compliant system doesn’t just separate customers, it adapts to their rules. Health providers need encrypted video and audit logs. Financial teams must archive calls immutably. Schools managing student data must enforce parental consent and retention rules.\n\nWith solutions like Netsapien’s hosted PBX solution, you can run a common cloud foundation with centralized efficiency. On top of that, you plug in compliance modules tailored to each sector’s demands.\n\nThe Importance of Industry-Specific Compliance Architecture\n\nCompliance doesn’t look the same for everyone. Healthcare, finance, education, and legal teams aren’t dealing with the same threats or regulations. Their needs are wildly different, right down to how they store call logs or who gets access to chat transcripts.\n\nEvery Industry Has Its Own Rulebook\n\nIn healthcare, HIPAA requires full encryption for all levels of conversations, strict audit trails, and signed Business Associate Agreements with vendors. Providers need to know exactly who accessed what and when. A misplaced access log could lead to investigations or fines that hit seven figures.\n\nFinance has its own rules. FINRA and SEC demand recorded conversations stored immutably, often for years. Those recordings need to be instantly retrievable and legally defensible. You can’t afford a missed call or a broken audit trail.\n\nSchools have to follow FERPA and COPPA. That means protecting student data, enforcing parental consent, and sometimes applying stricter controls based on age groups. One-size-fits-all security won’t get you there. Organizations need a way to apply the right protections to the right people at the right time.\n\nIt’s not just about the tools, either; it’s about the context. You can have great encryption, robust access controls, and reliable logging. But if a receptionist has the same access as a clinician in a hospital, or a junior analyst in a bank can delete archived calls, then your system’s not compliant. Context matters.\n\nA multi-compliant platform lets you build policies around the actual work people are doing, not just the system they’re using. For service providers, this isn’t just a risk management issue. It’s a business strategy. Being able to offer HIPAA-ready services or FINRA-compliant contact centers makes you more valuable to regulated industries. You open up new verticals and win deals your competitors can’t even bid on.\n\nA Platform Built for Industry-Specific Compliance\n\nNetsapiens has taken a measured approach to solving compliance problems, offering service providers a hosted multi-tenant solution that can adapt to thousands of different client needs. A healthcare provider can access specific controls for HIPAA-compliant conversations, while a finance leader can bake in call recording with session encryption and access logs.\n\nAccording to one service provider (DiRad), NetSapien’s architecture has helped them become a major contact center player in the healthcare industry, one of the most regulated and complex sectors in the world.\n\nThe system supports fine-grained isolation, so each tenant gets their own compliance profile. Role-based access control, audit logging, and encryption are all included and ready to customize to suit each client’s needs. The result is flexibility without fragmentation.\n\nUpdates and patches roll out platform-wide, but compliance features can be toggled on a per-tenant basis. If one client requires additional privacy controls, they get them. If another doesn’t need those features, they don’t pay for what they don’t use.\n\nNetsapiens even uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to deliver advanced analytics, automated disaster recovery, zero-trust capabilities, DDoS prevention, and real-time threat detection. It’s an end-to-end approach to making communications not just more reliable but safer, too.\n\nHow the Architecture Delivers Industry-Specific Compliance\n\nNetsapien’s approach to optimizing the future of communications goes beyond focusing on features. It’s the architecture that really makes the difference. A flexible, multi-tenant core gives service providers a shared foundation for scalable voice, messaging, video infrastructure, global updates, and unified monitoring. In addition, each tenant gets a compliance profile tailored to their industry.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nLogical Separation : Tenants stay separate at the data layer, isolated databases or schemas ensure one tenant’s data never leaks into another’s environment. Policies apply to each tenant independently. Updates happen once, but they respect every client’s settings.\n\n: Tenants stay separate at the data layer, isolated databases or schemas ensure one tenant’s data never leaks into another’s environment. Policies apply to each tenant independently. Updates happen once, but they respect every client’s settings. Role-Based Access Controls : This means policies say who can initiate a video call, who can view it, and who can delete it. In healthcare, nurses get different permissions than physicians. In finance, only compliance officers can download recorded calls.\n\n: This means policies say who can initiate a video call, who can view it, and who can delete it.

Compliance Logs and Auditing : Every access, call, session, or download is logged along with timestamps, user IDs, and device IPs. If an auditor comes knocking, providers can pull tailored log reports by tenant or timeframe without combing through a merged data dump.\n\n: Every access, call, session, or download is logged along with timestamps, user IDs, and device IPs. If an auditor comes knocking, providers can pull tailored log reports by tenant or timeframe without combing through a merged data dump. Demand Compliance Workflows: Rather than customizing per tenant manually, administrators use a UI to flip on modules. This activates video encryption, call monitoring, retention policies, etc. Updates, like new regulations, roll out platform-wide. Tenants receive any new compliance features automatically based on their profile.\n\nBringing all this together means providers don’t build separate stacks for each regulation. They maintain one stable, efficient foundation that scales control and trust across industries.\n\nCompliance as a Growth Strategy\n\nCreating a platform tuned to the needs of industry-specific compliance is a great way to help businesses avoid penalties. It’s also a direct route to winning better business for service providers.\n\nMulti-tenant UCaaS systems drive clear ROI with lower infrastructure costs, predictability, and streamlined operations. These modern UCaaS setups can boost productivity, reduce shadow IT, and centralize governance, leading to measurable gains in both time and money saved.\n\nIn addition, providers who offer HIPAA-grade or FINRA-ready services tap into premium markets. They can pitch to healthcare groups, financial advisors, legal firms, or schools, clients who expect compliance out of the box. They’re not just offering chat or video; they’re offering security that meets regulatory demands. That’s a far stronger play than competing only on features or price.\n\nOperationally, delivering compliance per tenant avoids expensive, entirely separate environments. You enable policies only where they’re needed, avoid over-engineering, and roll out updates globally. Meanwhile, clients benefit from faster onboarding. Netsapiens partners have reported significantly shorter setup times when compliance features are part of the platform by default.\n\nFuture Trends: AI, Confidential Computing, and Beyond\n\nDesigning multi-compliant systems isn’t easy. You’re dealing with shared infrastructure, evolving laws, and higher stakes. Data leakage, tenant misconfiguration, and outdated encryption can compromise your platform.\n\nAt the same time, compliance demands keep evolving, and vendors are paying more attention to cutting-edge tech ready to enhance industry-specific compliance. AI-driven anomaly detection is already helping providers flag suspicious access or behavior in real time. Soon, confidential computing, hardware-based secure enclaves, will let systems process sensitive data without exposure.\n\nExpect more granular data sovereignty tools, too, auto-assigning workloads to data centers based on regulation or masking sensitive fields dynamically depending on user roles. Platforms will need to bootstrap contextual workflows, such as parental consent in education, consent tracking for telehealth sessions, or dynamic call archiving for financial services.\n\nAt the end of the day, the next-generation compliance model isn’t reactive. It learns, adapts, and applies controls only where needed, to balance usability, security, and legal responsibility.\n\nA New Era of Industry-Specific Communication Compliance\n\nFor service providers, building platforms that adapt to the regulatory realities of different industries is quickly becoming the new baseline. Whether it’s encrypted video calls for clinicians, long-term call archiving for wealth advisors, or student data protections for schools, compliance has to be built into the architecture, not bolted on later.\n\nNetsapiens shows what this looks like in practice. A single, multi-tenant foundation that scales efficiently, layered with compliance modules that activate only when needed. It’s smart, flexible, and future-ready. Just as important, it allows service providers to move faster, onboard regulated clients with less friction, and stay ahead of shifting legal expectations.\n\nFor anyone designing or deploying communication platforms today, the next era isn’t just multi-tenant, it’s multi-compliant, industry-specific, and customizable. Anything else will simply crumble as regulations continue to evolve."

        "cleaned_text": "Retail doesn’t wait. It doesn’t slow down for missed calls, dropped video links, or disconnected store teams. Whether you’re running 30 stores or 3,000, your frontline workers, HQ staff, logistics partners, and customer service agents all need to be on the same page, often quite literally.\n\nIn 2025, that means investing in a unified communications and collaboration platform that authentically connects your workforce, flexes around your tech stack, and helps you move fast without breaking things.\n\nThe problem is that most platforms weren’t built with retail in mind. They were made for offices, not aisles. That’s why IT and tech leaders in retail need to look beyond buzzwords and focus on what actually works for their business: mobility, integrations, speed, scale, and a platform that understands the organised chaos of retail operations.\n\nHere’s what’s broken in retail communication today, and suggestions for how to fix it.\n\nThe Communication Headaches Retail Can’t Afford\n\nArguably, most retail communication setups are a mess. HQ uses Microsoft Teams, stores rely on group chats or personal mobiles, and customer service runs on a contact centre that barely talks to anything else. The result is often disconnected teams, duplicated work, missed opportunities, and managers scrambling to pull information from five different systems.\n\nAdd in high staff turnover, perpetually shifting rotas, supply chain glitches, and pressure to deliver standout customer experiences, and suddenly, reliable comms are absolutely essential.\n\nFacilities and HR teams struggle to roll out consistent training and updates, IT is stretched trying to keep everything patched and connected, and execs want real-time data from every corner of the operation. It’s no wonder more retailers are ditching fragmented tools for UC platforms that bring voice, video, messaging, and collaboration into one place.\n\nWhat Retailers Should Really Look for in a UC&C Platform\n\nForget the fluff. Retailers need platforms that are:\n\nMobile-first and store-ready. Your people aren’t sitting at desks; they’re on the floor, in the backroom, or on the move. The platform needs to work seamlessly across devices, even on flaky Wi-Fi.\n\nAI-smart, not AI-hype. You don’t need AI that generates poems. You need AI that routes calls smartly, writes summaries, flags issues, and helps your teams move faster.\n\nPlug-and-play with your stack. Whether it’s POS systems, ERP, inventory tools, or Salesforce, your UC platform has to speak the same language. Otherwise, you’re just building another silo.\n\nCompliant and secure. Retail handles a lot of sensitive data, such as payment info, customer profiles, and staff records. If your platform doesn’t have baked-in compliance, it’s a liability.\n\nSimple to scale. You don’t want a 12-month rollout across regions, but a system that works across 1 site or 1,000, with admin controls that don’t require a PhD.\n\nNow, let’s get into the contenders.\n\nMicrosoft Teams: The Corporate Backbone (But With Retail Grit?)\n\nIf you’re already deep in the Microsoft ecosystem, Teams feels like a natural choice. It ties neatly into Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, Excel; the whole M365 gang. You get chat, calls, meetings, file-sharing, task management, and some solid security under the hood.\n\nTeams excels at internal collaboration, particularly. It’s great for head office, finance, HR, and training. You can spin up Teams channels for different stores or departments, drop in files, run live video training, and keep everything archived and auditable.\n\nThe downside might be that it’s a bit corporate. If your store staff aren’t used to it, onboarding can feel heavy. Meanwhile, Microsoft has improved its webinars and external meeting features, but it’s still a step behind Zoom in terms of external-facing capabilities.\n\nGood for: Retailers already using Microsoft 365, or with large HQ teams needing structured workflows.\n\nWatch out for: Extra costs if you also need Zoom, and a steeper learning curve for non-desk workers.\n\nZoom Workplace: The People’s Favourite, Now With More Muscle\n\nZoom used to be the video call app. Now, it’s a full UC platform, Zoom Workplace, which combines meetings, chat, whiteboard, phone, and AI tools. It’s slick, lightweight, and ridiculously easy to use.\n\nFor retailers, Zoom hits the sweet spot when it comes to training, vendor collaboration, or cross-store meetings. The interface is clean, mobile-friendly, and familiar even to new hires. Zoom’s AI tools, like meeting summaries and smart recordings, cut admin time. If you need to bring in partners, franchisees, or external vendors, it’s hard to beat.\n\nThat said, integration with legacy systems or complex workflows isn’t as deep as Microsoft or RingCentral. Also, if you’re also using Teams for internal stuff, running both adds up.\n\nGood for: Retailers who prioritise ease-of-use, training, and smooth external communications.\n\nWatch out for: Integration gaps and potential platform overlap if you’re already tied to Microsoft.\n\nRingCentral: Built for Call-Heavy, Always-On Retail Ops\n\nRingCentral takes voice seriously. It’s built for organisations where the phone still rules: contact centres, support teams, and store-to-HQ comms. But it also includes messaging, video, task tools and a powerful mobile app.\n\nRetailers with centralised support hubs or distributed customer service teams will appreciate its deep call routing, voicemail-to-text, analytics, and AI-powered assistant tools. It integrates well with Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, and other key enterprise apps. Additionally, it’s built for scale. If you’re opening new sites, it grows with you.\n\nIt has a bit more of an “old-school enterprise” feel, which can be a plus or minus depending on your culture. The interface isn’t as friendly as Zoom’s, but the backend is rock solid.\n\nGood for: Retailers who run large contact centres or prioritise high-volume voice and customer interactions.\n\nWatch out for: A slightly clunky interface and pricing complexity depending on features.\n\nCisco Webex: Enterprise Power, If You’ve Got the Muscle\n\nCisco Webex has been doing this for decades, and it shows. Its infrastructure is secure, reliable, and compliant across global regions. It comes with advanced calling, messaging, meeting, and contact centre tools, plus excellent in-room hardware support if you’re building next-gen collaboration spaces at HQ or in flagship stores.\n\nIt’s a strong option for larger or global retailers that need strict compliance and performance guarantees. However, it does come with a learning curve, and it’s not always intuitive for store staff.\n\nGood for: Global or security-conscious retailers needing bulletproof infrastructure.\n\nWatch out for: Complexity and heavier deployment requirements.\n\nMitel: The Quiet Contender for Hybrid Environments\n\nMitel often flies under the radar, but it’s got some serious strengths, especially for retailers with legacy phone systems or hybrid environments. It supports on-prem, cloud, or hybrid setups, integrates with Teams, and doesn’t force you to rip and replace.\n\nIt’s less flashy than Zoom or Teams, but it does the job well, particularly for voice-centric operations that want a phased move to the cloud. The interface feels a bit dated in places and lacks some of the newer AI tools, but for certain retailers, that’s a fair trade-off for flexibility.\n\nGood for: Retailers with existing Mitel infrastructure or hybrid comms environments.\n\nWatch out for: Less modern UI and fewer native integrations.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nRetailers categorically need a platform that can handle the realities of the shop floor, the boardroom, and the call centre without missing a beat. In 2025, the best UC&C solution is the one that brings your people, your tech stack, and your customers together in real time.\n\nGo with Microsoft Teams if you’re all-in on M365 and need a structured, secure environment.\n\nChoose Zoom if you want ease, adoption speed, and standout external meeting experiences.\n\nPick RingCentral if voice is your lifeline and contact centres are core to your business.\n\nLean toward Webex if you want a fortress of compliance and enterprise reliability.\n\nLook at Mitel if you’re transitioning from legacy systems and want a flexible migration path.\n\nJust don’t settle for a platform that doesn’t get retail. Because in this industry, the difference between “out of stock” and “sold out” often comes down to how fast your teams can communicate."

        "title": "What is Zoom Tasks and What Can it Do for Enterprises?",
        "cleaned_text": "What is Zoom Tasks, and what can it really do for businesses? Well, first of all, it’s not your traditional “task management” tool. Zoom Tasks is one of the newest components of Zoom’s agentic AI roadmap – designed to prove the company is about more than just video conferencing.\n\nIt was introduced in March 2025 as part of a major update to both Zoom Workplace, and Zoom AI Companion – the built-in AI assistant, similar to Microsoft Copilot. This tool can automatically identify action items from a meeting, assign “to-do” actions to specific team members, and even help each employee complete projects throughout the day.\n\nIt’s really an extension of Zoom’s AI assistant, which makes it a more proactive digital colleague capable of aligning teams, consolidating information, and streamlining review and approval.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is Zoom Tasks? A New Agentic Experience\n\nZoom Tasks is an AI-powered task management solution powered by AI Companion and integrated into Zoom Workplace. Unlike your standard “task management app”, it doesn’t just give you a central place where you can track and manage to-do lists.\n\nWith Zoom Tasks, every team gets an intelligent assistant committed to maintaining project momentum. This assistant listens in during meetings, making notes when someone requests a report or mentions a problem. It then drafts action items and issues them to specific team members in a dedicated section of Zoom Workplace.\n\nUsers can review these tasks, add them to their to-do list, and then get immediate suggestions for how to complete a task from AI Companion by clicking on an icon. Zoom created this agentic AI task management tool to address the challenges companies usually face with distributed teams.\n\nFor instance, a third of leaders spend more than an hour just following up with teammates to check on the status of a project (costing around $16,000 per year in inefficiencies). Then you’ve got the issue of tracking everything that’s mentioned in a meeting to contend with, too.\n\nZoom Tasks centralizes task information, smart suggestions, and workflow automation into one environment, saving everyone time and effort.\n\nWhat is Zoom Tasks for? Enterprise Applications\n\nSo, what does Zoom Tasks actually do for enterprise teams? Zoom says it’s here to make managing workflows easier. If you’re struggling to keep track of endless notes and to-do items from back-to-back meetings, you can switch on Zoom Tasks, and it’ll consolidate everything into your handy “Tasks” tab. When you need to provide team leaders with status updates, AI Companion can use your task info to draft those messages for you.\n\nWhen you’re absolutely overwhelmed by a pile of work, you can head into Zoom Tasks and get AI Companion to help you out with hints on where to start, or ask it to do things for you, like compile research, write the first draft of an email, or schedule a meeting.\n\nHow Teams Can Use Zoom Tasks\n\nHere’s an idea of how that kind of functionality might translate into workflows across the enterprise.\n\nSales: For Sales teams, Zoom Tasks can gather information during a discovery call and assign tasks like “Send a follow-up” emails to specific employees. It can even connect with CRM platforms to make it easier to log notes and track pipeline status.\n\nFor Sales teams, Zoom Tasks can gather information during a discovery call and assign tasks like “Send a follow-up” emails to specific employees.

HR Teams: For companies using Zoom for hiring, onboarding, and even everyday HR processes, Zoom Tasks makes it easy to track each action item, from reviewing resumes to scheduling onboarding lunches and tracking time off requests.\n\nBasically, Zoom Tasks can benefit any team that needs to keep track of complicated to-do lists and get help with projects along the way.\n\nWhat is Zoom Tasks? How it Compares to Traditional Tools\n\nAt a glance, it might look like Zoom Tasks is just another to-do list generator (with a little AI baked in). Plenty of task and project management tools offer AI features today. But there are a few things that make Zoom Tasks stand out.\n\nFirst, this tool lives inside your day-to-day workflows, with built-in meeting and chat integration, so teams can work on projects collaboratively, without jumping between tools.\n\nYou’re not manually transferring notes to a task board. Zoom’s AI is listening, parsing, and acting the moment the words leave your mouth (or keyboard).\n\nIt also proactively takes action on your behalf. Once admins enable this tool, they can ask it to assign tasks to teams, monitor progress, and generate status reports automatically in the background, without having to do extra work.\n\nIt also comes included with approved Workplace plans, so you’re not paying extra for another AI tool, like ChatGPT.\n\nGetting Started with Zoom Tasks\n\nZoom Tasks (with AI Companion) comes built into eligible Zoom Workplace plans (the free plan doesn’t include this feature). If you’re on the right paid plan already, make sure your Zoom Workplace is up-to-date (version 6.4.3). After that, you’ll need to switch the feature on.\n\nGo to your online account settings, click the AI Companion tab, then scroll down until you see “Tasks”. Enable the option to have AI Companion manage and create tasks for you. You can also allow the bot to generate tasks from meeting transcripts.\n\nOnce the feature is enabled, you can view your Tasks from an icon in the top navigation bar of Zoom Workplace. If you can’t see it, click the “More” button.\n\nQuick tips:\n\nCheck your Recommended Tasks list at the end of each day to see anything that’s been assigned to you. You can click Accept to add those tasks to your list.\n\nlist at the end of each day to see anything that’s been assigned to you. You can click to add those tasks to your list. To get suggestions for a task, click the star icon for AI Companion within any task you’re reviewing.\n\nwithin any task you’re reviewing. Right-click on tasks that appear in your Zoom chat or email threads to manually add them to your Task list.\n\nClick View Details on any assigned tasks for more information about what you need to do, or insights from meetings.\n\nOne other note – if you’re not using AI Companion, you can still use Zoom Tasks for basic task management. You’ll just need to manually create, assign, and manage your own to-do list.\n\nWhat is Zoom Tasks? The Future of Productivity\n\nZoom Tasks with AI Companion is just one highlight in a series of agentic-AI-enhanced updates rolling out to Zoom Workplace. Already, Zoom is experimenting with custom workflow options within the AI Companion studio. There are also options to connect Zoom Tasks to third-party apps.\n\nGoing forward, expect even more advanced agentic AI solutions from Zoom. That might include a companion that creates, assigns, and updates tasks, adjusts them as priorities change, alerts you before a deadline slips away, and suggests options when a task is “blocked”.\n\nWith solutions like Zoom Tasks and AI Companion, Zoom isn’t just helping you to organize your to-do list. It’s giving you a more intuitive way to orchestrate your entire workday."

The law has changed. Our job is to make compliance painless.”\n\nFrom July 2025, the law changed and venues must respond accordingly. This means that any venue offering public WiFi to children must block access to illegal or age-inappropriate material; complete a children’s online risk assessment; follow Ofcom’s Protection of Children Code of Practice; and be able to produce records proving compliance.\n\nFailure to act could result in regulatory enforcement, fines up to £18m, and reputational damage — even for small businesses or councils unaware of the changes.\n\nGuest Metrics is designed for adoption by venue operators, IT resellers, and telecoms service providers, and gives full support for multi-tenant environments.\n\nRobinson concluded: “As someone who’s worked in telecoms for over a decade, I’ve seen the gaps in public access networks — especially when it comes to safety and accountability.\n\n“With Guest Metrics, we’ve built something that makes WiFi access safer for children and simpler for venue owners.

        "title": "AI Hype: Why the Noise is Slowing Sales",
        "cleaned_text": "We are deep in the AI hype cycle. Generative AI, LLMs, Agentic AI - buzzwords dominate the headlines. Gartner defines this cycle as the journey from inflated expectations to disillusionment before reaching meaningful, practical use. That’s where we are now.\n\nBut let’s not forget, AI isn’t new. IBM Watson made headlines as far back as 2004 and famously won Jeopardy! in 2011. The novelty isn’t the tech; it’s the marketing surge and the avalanche of claims that AI will replace call centers, SDRs, and more. Maybe it will - eventually. But right now, all the hype is backfiring, especially when it comes to selling.\n\nHere are the three big reasons why:\n\n1. Buyers Are Confused\n\nSurveys are divided: some say AI boosts productivity; others call it delusional. Many businesses are caught in the middle, unsure of what’s real. In any tech adoption curve, most customers are not early adopters. They’re risk-averse and wary of change. Selling cloud services is already hard, you’re asking a business to abandon a system they’ve used for years. Selling AI? Even harder. It’s change on steroids.\n\n2. FOMO Leads to Paralysis\n\nBecomes the Future PBX dealers once dominated business telecom. They sold, installed, trained, and maintained systems. When UCaaS emerged, many assumed they were obsolete. Wrong. Turns out, the skill set didn’t die—it evolved. Businesses still want hands-on implementation, training, MACD, and Tier 1 support. The PBX dealers who realized this pivoted and are now charging multiples over the $13-per-seat nonsense.\n\n3. AI Still Requires Strategy and Structure\n\nThe idea of a magical AI agent answering every customer question sounds great, until you realize it needs structure, data, and a solid plan. Anyone who’s ever built a website, an IVR system, or a reporting dashboard knows it’s not plug-and-play. AI is no different. Strategy, architecture, and accessible data are prerequisites, and most small businesses aren’t ready.\n\nIn fact, many don’t even have usable data. Even larger enterprises are stuck with siloed or unstructured data that AI can’t digest. No data, no insights. It’s like trying to run a restaurant without ingredients.\n\nWe’ve been here before. Think of that complex IVR system that had to be mapped out, step by step. Who’s calling? What do they want? What data powers the experience? The same logic applies to AI - just more complex, with higher expectations.\n\nTo move forward, businesses need more than buzzwords - they need concrete use cases that clearly explain what problem is being solved, for whom, and how. And let’s not forget: users typically only tap into 10% of Microsoft Office’s features. Adoption has always been a challenge - and with AI, it’s likely worse.\n\nWant to Sell AI? Make It Simple\n\nIf you’re selling AI, treat it like a band-aid: easy to apply, obvious in value, and clearly better than the alternative. That means:\n\nFocused, low-risk use cases\n\nClear ROI within weeks, not years\n\nPre-configured outcomes with minimal setup\n\nUntil then, the hype might just be your biggest competitor.\n\nFor further information visit:\n\nhttps://www.netsapiens.com/partners/"

        "title": "Comms Vision Conference 2025: Delivering an Outcome and Value Bonus",
        "cleaned_text": "Achieving strong and sustained growth in a competitive market calls for a multifaceted approach and a focus on where to evolve and where to reinvent – but the imperative to deliver ‘more for less’ to exacting customers further complicates the conundrum. Therefore, this year’s gold standard Comms Vision Convention (12th-14th November, Gleneagles) doubles down on how to create a model that brings Outcome and Value Bonuses (OVBs) not just for end users, but also for MSPs needing to optimise their own operations to ensure long-term, and streamlined, business growth.\n\nThe biggest challenges facing MSPs today are to ensure more business growth at no extra cost while delivering higher value to customers along with productivity gains for their own organisation. But driving business transformation in a competitive and saturated market, with pressure from end users wanting more for less from their tech investments and MSP relationships, how far, and where, do MSPs need to evolve and reinvent to meet these demands and differentiate? Is sticking to your knitting an option when solving this new customer RoI and MSP efficiency equation?\n\nCustomer demand for an Outcome and Value Bonus will only intensify, but how to deliver more RoI and grow at the same time is the challenge facing channel firms. Solving this equation is key to sustained competitive success\n\nStriking the right balance between evolution and reinvention to drive value and deliver more outcomes – while growing your business more efficiently – will be the pivotal factor when planning for competitive success. This also brings into question the viability of traditional channel models.\n\nCustomer demand for OVBs will only intensify, but how to deliver more RoI and grow at the same time is the strategic challenge facing channel firms. To help unravel this conundrum Comms Vision will, in part, explore how the critical field of Enhanced Consultancy will become the new competitive battlefield, and how gaining control of margin erosion can also help MSPs deliver the more for less business agenda.\n\nKey questions\n\n1. In order to meet today’s and tomorrow’s customer OVB expectations, which parts of your own operations, platforms and GTM will need rethinking or reinventing? Is your consultancy practice good enough to compete long-term? Have you got control of margin erosion? Are you making the right decisions?\n\n2. How should technology/vendor partnerships evolve to maximise RoI for customers and your own business?\n\n3. How can you ensure that your workforce is future-ready to drive exceptional value for all stakeholders?\n\nComms Vision’s agenda will show how an interconnected approach to overcoming these siloed challenges will enable MSPs to create a blueprint for delivering more customer value, while securing their business’s long-term viability through...\n\nThe Interconnected Solve\n\n1. Strike the right balance\n\nPairing your own company’s efficiency and productivity roadmap with revenue growth strategies is now a priority. And understanding where to focus when developing a future-fit operational, GTM, CX and customer value approach will be the silver bullet. This involves harnessing today’s technology, including AI powered end-to-end data management, and tackling the age old problem of how to erase the impacts of margin erosion on performance – which is too often overlooked despite its potential to help MSPs deliver more for less. We also explore how matching operational excellence to Enhanced Consultancy practices could make a decisive difference in the evolving ICT market battleground.\n\n2. Forge the right partnerships\n\nMSP and customer priorities are inseparable from the broader channel ecosystem, which brings into focus the future direction of strategic partnerships which are under pressure to be more intertwined and strategically aligned, in order to target the right tech and business markets, drive growth through greater collaboration, operational and platform efficiency, and promote integration and automation between partners. But how far is the channel’s supply chain responding to these pressures and evolving in order to deliver compelling OVBs? And are we moving fast enough?\n\n3. Fire up your team power\n\nComms Vision will also focus on how this all links into the evolution of an agile MSP workforce fit for the future, primed to help deliver more outcome-led value through the elevation of your organisation’s capacity to innovate, disrupt and grow through a thriving people strategy. Building a workforce that’s responsive to change and new opportunities is vital for long-term success, and how to meet this challenge successfully hinges on your people and teamwork – just as much as the strategic business decisions you make. But how can we prepare for that mindset shift today?\n\n4. Decide on next moves\n\nKnowing what to consider when transition planning for a stronger future is a challenge for MSP leaders, therefore Comms Vision has set out to provide a framework that incorporates recommendations and guidance to help inform the astute decision making required to strike the right balance between evolution and reinvention, and deliver sustainable OVBs to customers while driving your own growth agenda.\n\nSolving the channel’s more for less strategic equation – a 10 point plan\n\n1. Take consultancy to the next level\n\n2. Solve the new customer RoI equation\n\n3. Boost operational and GTM efficiency\n\n4. Make your data work for you\n\n5. Erase margin erosion\n\n6. Get empowered through productive partnering\n\n7. Realise your people and team potential\n\n8. Understand where to evolve, where to reinvent and how to differentiate\n\n9. Take the right strategic decisions\n\n10. Develop sustained leadership excellence\n\nAbout Comms Vision...\n\nComms Vision is the leading annual leadership forum for CEO, MD and CTO delegates making up the major league of the UK reseller and MSP community.

        "cleaned_text": "A new study has revealed security vulnerabilities in UK businesses, with nearly half of companies experiencing data breaches caused by unmanaged or unseen devices in the past year alone.\n\nThe research, “Bridging the Visibility Gap,” was carried out by unified endpoint management provider Scalefusion surveying IT leaders across the UK, and uncovered critical blind spots in enterprise device management that are leaving organisations exposed to cyber threats.\n\nKey survey findings showed that more than two-thirds (67%) of IT leaders lack complete visibility into all work devices across their organisation, with nearly a quarter (23.5%) detecting unauthorised devices accessing corporate data at least monthly, and with over a third of breach victims experiencing attacks monthly.\n\nOnly 35% of IT leaders feel very confident in their team's ability to quickly contain and remediate security incidents.\n\nThe study reveals that the shift to hybrid and remote working has created challenges for IT security teams, and 64% of organisations discovered previously unknown devices or applications being used for work purposes in the last year, highlighting the extent of shadow IT operations.\n\nFrequent security incidents among affected companies showed that among the 48% who experienced breaches from unmanaged devices, over a third (35%) reported facing attacks on at least a monthly basis, indicating that these are not isolated incidents but ongoing, systematic vulnerabilities.\n\nThe research also exposed how organisations' attempts to address security challenges may be making matters worse. 59% of companies are using four or more different endpoint security tools, creating a complex web of systems that's proving counterproductive – and this tool proliferation is causing significant operational challenges.\n\nOnly 7% of organisations claimed to face no problems from their multi-tool approach.\n\nSally King, Channel Sales Manager UK&I at Scalefusion (pictured) commented: “These findings confirm that there's a critical gap between the security challenges organisations face and their ability to address them effectively. Visibility and simplification is needed, with a unified approach that brings all endpoints under one management umbrella rather than juggling multiple disconnected systems.”\n\nThe study suggests that organisations recognising these challenges and moving toward unified solutions are better positioned to address the evolving threat landscape while reducing operational complexity."

        "cleaned_text": "New research from Akamai Technologies reveals that businesses across Europe are facing rising cloud infrastructure costs and are struggling to realise value from AI investments, with a ‘significant disconnect’ between cloud and AI spending and the ability to measure tangible returns.\n\nIt also shows that businesses are making cuts to their AI, cybersecurity, and IT staffing budgets to accommodate growing cloud costs.\n\nAccording to Akamai’s findings in the Opinium report, polling 750 IT decision makers in the UK, France and Germany responsible for cloud software & infrastructure and/or AI applications, only 35% of EMEA businesses stay with their current cloud provider because they are satisfied and see no need to explore alternatives.\n\nResearch also found that 67% expect cloud costs to rise over the next year, with 42% anticipating increases of more than 10%. Cloud storage, analytics (39%), and AI-related services (37%) were the top factors behind the increased spending.\n\nDespite the anticipated cost rises, two in five say that the cost and complexity of migrating data and applications outweigh the potential benefits of switching providers.\n\nOver two-thirds (68%) of businesses are finding that increasing cloud costs are translating into less budget for other areas. As cloud spending accelerates due to the growing demands of AI, businesses are under pressure to reduce costs in other areas, with new AI projects (26%), cybersecurity (26%), and IT staff costs (24%) among the most frequently cited cutbacks. These trade-offs prompted one in five businesses to brand their cloud computing costs as “unmanageable.”\n\nJames Kretchmar, Global CTO, Cloud Technology at Akamai Technologies (pictured) said: “Cloud spending is growing fast and it’s holding businesses back from investing in growth and innovation, especially with AI, where businesses are struggling to squeeze ROI out of their investments.\n\n“Against this backdrop, cloud hyperscalers continue with contract lock-in and egress pricing, which means keeping cloud costs under control is impossible for many.”\n\nAI ambition is high, with 65% of businesses expecting to increase AI investment in the next 12 months. However, nearly 85% have not implemented a strategy for tracking return on investment (ROI) for their AI projects, with only 11% reporting their AI projects self-sustaining through cost or productivity gains.\n\nAnd just a quarter report having budgets that fully support their desired AI initiatives.\n\nKretchmar continued: “Leaders need to take a hard look at where they’re spending and what outcomes they expect. Companies must prioritise the quality of outcomes, looking beyond the legacy cloud providers to those architected for performance-sensitive applications like inference.”\n\nAI inference plays a critical role in automation, real-time decision-making and predictive analytics across a range of industries and applies this learning to new data in real time.\n\nRunning AI inference at the edge reduces latency and enables scalable, efficient execution avoiding dependence on centralised cloud platforms, and it is essential to shift computing workloads from the cloud to the edge.\n\nAkamai is supporting organisations in moving beyond traditional cloud models and achieving greater efficiency and value from their AI strategies."

It was a great opportunity to connect with multiple suppliers all in one place, making the interactions highly efficient. And the shared insights were truly beneficial.\"\n\nPaul Cunningham, UK Partner Week Summit Content Director, added: \"The business technology partner landscape is evolving at breakneck speed and the businesses that thrive are those that adapt, innovate and lead from the front.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, the UK Partner Week Summit was high impact, bringing together industry visionaries, successful practitioners and forward-thinking leaders for a day that helped delegates reshape how they approach growth, leadership and competitive advantage, whether they are channel veterans or navigating their career path.\"\n\nSetting the tone for the day was Jason Bevan, former Head of Development at Warner Bros, who opens the summit with an exploration of how VAR and MSP leaders can apply entertainment industry innovation principles to drive business transformation. The Summit closed with Karen Blackett OBE, former President at WPP whose remarkable career trajectory and leadership philosophy have made her one of the UK’s most respected business leaders.\n\nPictured above: The opening keynote from Jason Bevan, entitled ‘Rocketfuel Your Ambition, Innovation and Creativity.

        "cleaned_text": "As businesses become ever more reliant on digital tools, cloud platforms, and hybrid working, the demand for flexible, high-performance connectivity has never been greater.\n\nBut too many resellers still face limited choice, inflated prices, and carrier lock-in. In a market where agility is everything, channel partners need genuine choice, backed by competitive pricing and reliable support.\n\nThat’s where independent wholesale aggregators like VeloxServ are changing the game. As a fully independent, wholesale[1]only Full Fibre connectivity aggregator, VeloxServ isn’t tied to a single network or provider. Instead, it currently aggregates services from major carriers across the UK, including Openreach, CityFibre, Virgin Media O2 and Vodafone. More recently VeloxServ has also forged new relationships with other leading network providers such as ITS, FullFibre, Freedom Fibre and Vorboss, giving partners access and further depth to a truly comprehensive portfolio of broadband and Ethernet services.\n\nThis independence brings freedom. No bias, no upselling, no lock-in. Just clear, competitive pricing and fast quoting across multiple carriers, enabling faster sales cycles, better margins, and more customer choice.\n\nBut VeloxServ doesn’t just simplify pricing, it adds value across the customer journey as it continues to enhance its offering to partners. Further exciting developments to its partner portal in the coming months include a more expansive and intelligent pricing engine which allows partners to generate instant, location-specific quotes and order connectivity services seamlessly and efficiently.\n\nThe business has been founded on providing the highest quality customer service and technical support to service management and provisioning. And with a channel-only approach, partners never compete with VeloxServ for end users – removing a long-standing frustration that many face with larger providers.\n\nAt its core, VeloxServ is built around empowering partners. Its model enables MSPs, and ISPs to deliver tailored solutions that meet real-world business needs, without compromise on quality, price, or flexibility.\n\nIn an industry where choice equals competitive edge, VeloxServ offers a smarter way to buy and sell connectivity. For partners looking to grow, differentiate, and retain customers, it’s not just an aggregator – it’s a strategic ally.\n\nNeeds To find out more about being a VeloxServ partner please call 01902 924920 or email sales@veloxserv.co.uk"

It was a chance to step away from day[1]to-day pressures, reward hard work and strengthen team culture.” - Liam McNaughton, Consulting Director, Dental IT.\n\nThese rewards did more than boost morale for Dental IT.

        "title": "The 4 Pillars of Modern Sales: How to Sell When Growth",
        "cleaned_text": "Two important facts about sales. One, you need a plan, a strategy, a framework for sales. Two, fundamentals are required and need to be executed as best as possible and always improving.\n\nThe industry got lazy in 2020. Anyone that answered a phone was able to close a UC&C order. Not a sale, because no real selling was going on – just order taking. Now that cloud comms growth is in single digits, selling is required.\n\nSales people have gotten lazy on fundamentals too. They skip steps; hurry to close the deal. Meanwhile, Enterprise sales are slowing down. They take longer because of the macroeconomic environment and that more people are involved in the decision. Every sale is getting harder to bring to ink.\n\nWe need to go back to the 4 pillars: Focus/ Target; Positioning/Why?; Messaging/Earn Trust; Where to fish and how.\n\nNumber one: WHO BENEFITS THE MOST FROM YOUR SERVICES? The problem with most providers is that they think Everyone is a Customer. Unless you are BT or Orange that is incorrect. Even for those two giants, it isn’t everyone any more. There is a section of the marketplace that you can serve best. There is product-market fit. For that segment of the market, the service delivery results in benefits for the business. Look at your customers to see if any verticals or sizes or other characteristics stick out. What about your top customers is similar?\n\nThe second pillar is of course marketing. Positioning is about defining how your company is the best at something that the market cares about. It is part of defining the value proposition. The why you instead of the thousand other SPs that offer UC too. It is about benefits, customer needs, and your unique differentiator. An example of this could be that you are the best at delivering a communications platform to Zoho customers with 10 to 99 employees who achieve a 15% productivity gain from the combination.\n\nNow you may be thinking: that cuts our addressable market to a fraction. The largest US CLEC had 55K customers. 8x8 has 55K global businesses using their services. Zoom has 4,192 customers billing $100K+ in ARR. Think about the next 100 or 1000 customers that you want to acquire; not the next 100,000 or million.\n\nThe third pillar is Messaging. What are you saying to prospects and the market? Are you telling stories or pushing out PR? With AI replacing search, SEO won’t be as effective as stories about benefits and outcomes.\n\nWhat are stories valuable? Our brains are wired for stories. It is how we pass down human history. The use case could be a story about the impact your services had on a customer. If it was a good story, it would be memorable, which makes it repeatable and sticky. Sales Engineers are good at sales because they can map features to benefits and translate the technical to the business need. In telecom we push product; but businesses especially SMB buy solutions, not products. They don’t buy technology but what the tech can do for the business.\n\nThe final pillar is Where does the sales team fish? That depends. Start in your network. Look at verticals. Do you have former customers? It needs to be multi-threaded with cold outreach, referrals, networking, and other avenues. There is still money in emails. Social media can work. Obviously, this is more effort than before but that is just what is required now.\n\nStory-telling, Positioning, Targeting. And fishing are the 4 pillars of a sales plan that coupled with executing well on the sales fundaments is the path to success for providers.\n\nhttps://www.netsapiens.com"

While our look may be new, our mission remains unchanged: to empower resellers to tackle real-world challenges with secure, cloud solutions, and to build enduring partnerships that fuel long-term success.”\n\nThe brand development will focus on sales enablement and reseller resources, and a complete switch will be live from the end of August.\n\nHughes added: “Better aligning the team enables the business to focus on growth and proven business strategy.

        "title": "Preparing for an opportunity-rich, and successful future",
        "cleaned_text": "How to continue succeeding in an opportunity rich technology and business environment is a question facing many channel leaders under pressure to continuously stand out from the crowd and unclear about how to prepare themselves for ongoing long-term success. To help unravel the issues, BT Wholesale hosted a working lunch last month attended by leading MSPs and led by leadership coach Cally Beaton.\n\nAdapting to market change and leading from the front is key to being ultra-competitive, so Beaton unravelled the multifaceted challenges and opportunities facing today’s business leaders in the channel, and why they should ‘choose courage over comfort’ to compete more effectively, and ultimately turn each strategic decision and product expansion into a breakthrough event for their business.\n\nFor context, this channel insight session was held on the back of BT Wholesale’s launch of Teams Phone Mobile, a timely solution for resellers wanting to tap into surging demand for UC and collaboration tools. Today, Microsoft Teams has well over 320 million monthly active users and in 2023 Cavell estimated that only around 17 million are using Teams with telephony enabled – forecasting a massive rise to 40 million by 2027 (mainly in North America and Western Europe). Bolt on the fact that the broader UC market is tipped to be worth £155 billion by 2030 and the scale of the Microsoft Teams channel growth opportunity becomes crystal clear, so long as a bold, targeted and outcome-led value-building GTM approach is adopted.\n\nShifting mindsets towards outcomes and adding value will prove the key differentiator for MSPs\n\nShifting mindsets towards delivering outcomes and adding value will prove the key differentiator for MSPs moving forward, according to leaders attending the session. The discussion also pointed up how the way resellers and MSPs deliver services is changing, based on the imperative to build deeper customer relationships and create greater value.\n\nGTM strategy\n\nBut what is the best GTM approach for resellers wanting to attach high revenue, high margin services that drive more value and help them to differentiate? According to Maintel CEO Dan Davies, market differentiation has entered its third phase. He identified phase one as being speed and quality of installation, and categorised phase two as being how well you run your own systems. Phase three requires a consultative approach that delivers personalised solutions. “This is the only way to avoid a race to the bottom which is inevitable when you are selling the same solutions as those around you,” he said.\n\nPeter Watson, UC&C Product Manager at Wavenet, highlighted how he is changing the company’s sales behaviours to reflect this trend. “The old school sales mentality is to assume you lost a deal because the other party had a solution you aren’t offering,” he added. “This mindset leads to a bloated and unfocused portfolio that makes it harder for teams to sell and bundle. Instead, look at what more could have been done through a consultative process.”\n\nThis isn’t just a sales imperative, but something that marketers must also consider, according to Christopher Wellbelove DL (pictured left), Senior Marketing Consultant at BT Wholesale. He said: “Marketing hasn’t hit the sweet spot yet – messaging is too focused around technologies and their features, not the solutions they help to solve.”\n\nMeeting customer expectations\n\nTo deliver on the outcome expectations of customers, each MSP in attendance is narrowing their scope to ensure service is more tailored to specific verticals. Maintel has begun to focus on four key verticals, which were chosen after a comparison of areas where it is seeing success alongside identified high-growth markets.\n\nDigital Space has also gone through the process of focusing on where it can provide the most value. Richard Beeston, CTO/COO, added: “We built a £60 million monolith and have realised we can’t be everything to everybody. We are now looking at verticals where we can have the best conversations and are building technology stacks around the needs of those markets.”\n\nCourage\n\nAt the heart of this new mindset is courage, according to Alex Mawson, Product and Marketing Director (Mobile) at Giacom. He noted: “Sometimes you must be brave and tell customers you can’t deliver something. If you promise to deliver everything, you are going to erode trust in the future so focus your energy where you can be an expert because that is where trust is delivered.”\n\nWavenet has built verticalised strategies into its feedback loop. Sam Phillips, Mobile Product Manager, stated: “From a mobile point of view, we tell our teams to be active with questions so we can start to build a profile around the needs of a vertical. At the end of the day, it’s about providing what the customer wants, rather than what you want to provide the customer.”\n\nGavin Jones (pictured left), Director of Wholesale Channel at BT Business, extolled the virtues of bundling around certain verticals, and even at the more granular level of employee profiles. He added: “If you are a business selling individual solutions, you are missing a big opportunity. Start to bring pieces together and create bespoke communications packages.” He recommends unique bundles for mobile workers, desk workers and customer service workers. “This proactive approach is more targeted and easier to manage in the long run,” he added.\n\nDavies noted that this approach is in demand due to increased uncertainty in the end user base. He believes 90 per cent of Maintel’s customers just want to be advised. “They don’t care what the solution is, they just want it to work,” he said. “They aren’t tapped into a large technology strategy, their strategy is about where their business is in the now. Success for them is great outcomes without having to think about their resilience and security.”\n\nIf you’re selling individual solutions you’re missing a big opportunity. Bring pieces together and create bespoke communications packages\n\nThis all plays into the opportunity for resellers to capitalise on growing interest in UCaaS and collaboration platforms that integrate directly with Microsoft Teams and other applications, noted Jones. “Most businesses know that the age of the desk-bound phone system is a thing of the past,” he commented.\n\n“Hybrid working is the norm and UCaaS delivers streamlined communications and collaboration tools. Adding mobile capabilities enhances the offering further, and channel partners can establish themselves as indispensable technology enablers if they can provide it.”"

        "cleaned_text": "New research from Ekco reveals that more than half of businesses cannot effectively track their cloud spending, potentially undermining billions in infrastructure investment, and costing organisations significant value.\n\nThe Ekco Infrastructure Modernisation Survey of over 1,000 IT decision makers across the UK and Ireland shows that there is a quiet revolution underway in the cloud - and that it’s causing businesses to sleepwalk into unforeseen risks.\n\nAfter years of wishful thinking, hybrid cloud adoption is hitting the mainstream - but for most firms, it’s still uncharted territory.\n\nAs companies ramp up infrastructure modernisation efforts, the survey reveals that only one-third (33%) of cloud projects deliver on every goal.\n\nThis gap between partial and complete success is affecting companies, with many struggling to measure true return on investment due to poor cost visibility.\n\nLegacy infrastructure continues to be a major drag on innovation, with 71% of organisations reporting that outdated on-prem technology is actively holding them back.\n\nAmong those still relying heavily on legacy systems, 70% believe migrating to the cloud could reduce costs - yet 46% cite management failing to prioritise cloud migration as a key barrier.\n\nJames Young, Head of Technical Solution Architecture at Ekco (pictured) said: “Organisations are making substantial cloud investments, but without proper cost visibility and optimisation, they're essentially flying blind.\n\n“The jump to 68% hybrid adoption shows businesses want more control and governance, but that comes with complexity – a challenge that lends itself to a ‘FinOps’ approach, bringing together internal engineering, finance and business teams to ensure smarter, and more accountable cloud spending.”\n\nThe research also reveals interesting cultural shifts, with 82% reporting that moving to cloud helps create a more agile culture, suggesting the benefits extend far beyond technical improvements to fundamental business transformation.\n\nThe survey suggests that while cloud momentum remains strong with 98% of organisations considering cloud moves, the focus must shift from basic adoption to sophisticated optimisation and governance."

        "title": "Business updates point to strong H2 performances",
        "cleaned_text": "Last month’s Channel Forecast insight session gauged the business outlooks of three channel firms, assessing H1 company performance, their take on market trends, growth hotspots, the shift towards outcomes versus simple reselling, the channel engagement strategies that work best and what this all means for resellers and MSPs in H2 and beyond.\n\nThere’s plenty of scope for optimism in the coming six months, according to our panel of three industry experts, each reporting good growth, and all preparing for an H2 uptick. “We’ve had a strong first half of the year, measuring growth across most of our products and technologies with clear momentum in all the right areas compared to 2024,” said Ralph Mora, VP & GM EMEA Region, Nuso. “We are doing especially well where cloud adoption is maturing and have had a bright spot in integrating Microsoft Teams and Zoom Phone into our business telephony suite. We’re still building out this ecosystem so that partners can grow through a broader reach with richer solutions.”\n\nDespite a slower first quarter, Evolve IP has also seen growth pick up with record attendees at its April partner day. It is also planning an H2 spike by doubling down on its Microsoft play via the impending launch of Operator Connect. “We’ve built an ecosystem around the Microsoft piece with call recording, analytics and contact centre,” said Sales Director Jamie Hughes.\n\nHe also highlighted churn from smaller customers as another trend to keep an eye on. “This doesn’t have to be a negative, larger customers are stickier and one or two deals can make up for churn,” he said. “Our strategy is to point customers at the mid-market and enterprise space and avoid the low-end which can be a race to the bottom.”\n\nVeloxServ has also driven year-on-year growth, according to Head of Marketing Rob Tickle, having ramped up its connectivity offering and signing up a raft of new suppliers. He said that VeloxServ’s priority is to go all-in on marketing and partner enablement to add new resellers and deepen its relationship with existing partners. “The goal is around equipping our ISP and MSP partners with the right data, insight collateral and all the tools they need to be able to sell their value-added solutions confidently and differentiate themselves,” he said, noting that VeloxServ is aiming at the SME and mid-market customer base where demand is high for infrastructure.\n\nAll agreed that H1 trends were especially seen in changing customer spending habits. This is not characterised by a tightening of purse strings, but by more selective and strategic investment. Hughes commented: “Customers are retaining the same amount of spend but they are being more targeted about its deployment.”\n\nMora expanded on the point: “Customers are redirecting their spend towards platforms and services, often seeking more measurable impacts and looking to extract value from the existing technologies that they have.” Tickle summarised that customers are trying to spend smarter by ‘prioritising reliability, efficiency and a more long-term return on investment’. He also noted an uptick in demand for flexible, scalable solutions.\n\nChanging perceptions around value mean vendors must facilitate a change in their go-to-market approach for resellers. Mora explained: “The best-performing and smartest resellers aren’t just chasing revenue, they’re building relevance and resilience to make their customer relationships stickier. Relevance means staying aligned with customer expectations, so these resellers are looking for vendors who offer flexible go-to-market options and strong enablement pieces.”\n\nHughes also emphasised the new value perceptions facing resellers, as well as Evolve IP’s enablement strategy. He said: “If you go into a meeting and talk about features you’re going to be brushed aside. It’s now about measurable outcomes and long-term value.”\n\nTo accommodate this, Evolve IP has restructured its sales teams, implementing Technical Account Managers to deliver on outcomes. The company has also invested in tools that chew customer data to quantify business-specific efficiency savings. He added: “It is tangible and personalised and gives something for a CFO or wider buying committee to buy into.”\n\nVeloxServ is also shifting how it does business alongside partners. Tickle said: “Our partner engagements now focus more on collaboration and cooperation, not just the reselling of services. It’s strategic enablement that we’re offering because that’s where the real value is. The winners ultimately will be those that can guide their customers through complexities and deliver tangible results at the end of it.”\n\nNuso is also facilitating an outcome-based approach for partners by offering a range of options. “We’re constantly investing in technology to enable partners to keep adding value added services to their customers, through our own IP investments and through the acquisition of turnkey technologies,” said Mora. “It’s about allowing customers to enhance existing technology and then migrate, when convenient, to new platforms.\n\n“Our job is to help partners become advisors, not just sellers. If they win customers on trust and on value, we will all grow. Investing the time with the customer and truly understanding their business objectives, their model and their future aspirations remains a central tenet to our channel model.”\n\nWhere this approach can be particularly effective for resellers is when specialising down to specific verticals, according to Hughes. He extols the benefit of finding niche markets that resellers can totally own. He said: “If you can package the best solutions and position them in a way that addresses a sector’s niche needs, perhaps with the help of an industry expert, then that world is your oyster. You will build momentum through word of mouth and a growing base of case studies. From a valuation point of view that is going to be a lot more appealing to some buyers.”\n\nThis consultative approach requires tighter strategic proximity between suppliers and partners than ever before. Therefore, a key theme throughout the discussion was the steps being taken by vendors to become easier to do business with. Tickle added: “Growth comes from strategic collaboration so our focus is on being as frictionless to work with as possible.”\n\nThis is also a focus for Nuso which has relaunched its global websites to be more relevant to customers selling on outcomes. This came alongside a portal relaunch, a new platform allowing for numbering and porting selection and work on toolchain enablement. Evolve IP has taken a similar approach in addressing its partner portal and integrations, enabling its partners to begin provisioning their own numbers rather than having to raise a ticket.\n\nEfficiency matters\n\nHughes said: “This is the year for becoming more operationally efficient. As the channel, we need to train our thinking on the cost of doing business, not just the cost of buying services, because reductions here will be where the growth comes from. If you can streamline your business from transaction to delivery, you’ll naturally get growth not just through existing customers, but also for future prospects.”\n\nTickle advised: “Focus on partnerships that offer flexibility, transparency and long-term value. Growth isn’t about chasing volume, it’s about building trust and delivering consistently excellent service. Align with providers that understand your customer’s challenges and can help them to innovate.”\n\nMora also advocates for resellers to evaluate their existing vendor relationships. He said: “The market has changed, and people have changed, so as technology specialists, resellers should be looking all the time to see what other products and services are available, benchmarking themselves against their competition, and seeing how they can improve their customers journey through the technology minefield.”"

        "cleaned_text": "With almost 30 years experience in the tech industry under his belt Will Morey took the reins as Gamma Business Managing Director in May this year. Here, he discusses his motivations and strategy, how he intends to drive deeper relationships with partners, and why the launch of Gamma Edge could be a game changer in channel support.\n\nWhy did you take the role of Gamma Business MD?\n\nThis is a role that brings together everything I care about... real people, a trusted solution set and a channel I’ve been part of for decades. I’ve worked closely with many of our partners over the years, and I saw this as an opportunity to build on that and help shape the next phase of growth together.\n\nWhat strengths do you bring to the position?\n\nI’ve spent my whole career in this industry, from running large distributor teams to co-founding businesses and growing them from scratch. That experience has given me perspective. I understand the pressures partners face and how to help them respond. I’m collaborative and focused on long-term impact, not just short-term wins.\n\nWhat was your first priority as MD?\n\nTo listen. The best plans come from understanding what’s working and where the gaps are. That meant having open conversations with partners and teams, and using what we heard to shape a response that’s practical and genuinely helpful.\n\nWhat changes are you making, and how will you make your mark?\n\nWe’re aligning more closely with how partners want to work. That means clearer growth planning, easier access to the full Gamma portfolio and smarter commercial support. I want partners to feel that Gamma is not just backing their growth but actively enabling it every step of the way.\n\nHow did H1 this year shape up for Gamma Business?\n\nIn 2024, both the group and Gamma Business continued to grow strongly driven primarily by our UCaaS portfolio. So far in 2025, we’re seeing strong momentum. The real growth is coming from partners who are engaging across the portfolio and using the full Gamma offer to build smarter, more resilient propositions for their customers.\n\nWhat are your short and long-term priorities?\n\nRight now, it’s about delivery. We’ve created a more joined-up partner experience and now we’re rolling it out with energy and focus. Looking ahead, we have many exciting plans for our partners to shift to higher-value, recurring revenue models that support their long-term performance. That’s why we introduced Gamma Edge, the most complete support framework we have ever launched, designed to help partners grow smarter, sell more and create lasting value with their customers. It’s a platform that brings together everything a partner needs to succeed in one connected place.\n\nHow did Gamma Edge come about?\n\nWe did not build Edge in a boardroom. We built it by listening. Over the past six months and beyond we have spent time with our partners across the country, asking honest questions and hearing real answers about what is working, what is not and where we can do better together. Those conversations have shaped everything about Gamma Edge, from the insight we provide to the commercial tools and support available.\n\nHow is Gamma Edge structured?\n\nThere are five components. ‘Partner Pulse’ is where we start, with joint business planning that’s genuinely co-created. No two partners are the same. It’s about tailoring Gamma’s approach to each and every partner.\n\n‘Velocity’ turns that plan into reward. It’s a simplified rebate engine that recognises performance across the entire Gamma portfolio – UCaaS, connectivity, mobile and security. The more a partner grows with us, the more they earn. We’ve designed it to be transparent and scalable. ‘Elements’ gives parters the tools to deliver, and ‘Boost’ adds momentum. These are ready-to-go commercial accelerators created to help partners win faster.\n\n‘Migrate’ helps partners protect and future-proof their base. It combines platform risk analysis with tools to move customers away from legacy estates, securely, smoothly and with full support. Migrate is about reducing churn and simplifying the transition to modern platforms.\n\nWhere do you see the Gamma channel in three years?\n\nI want our partners to be more confident, more profitable and better supported. That means helping them grow faster, reduce risk and deepen their customer relationships all with a simpler, more scalable Gamma experience behind them. I’m confident that will happen.\n\nWhich market trends are shaping your thinking?\n\nWe’re seeing real demand for simplicity, value and trust. Customers want fewer suppliers and more dependable outcomes. For partners, that means making smart choices about what to sell and who to sell it with. That’s exactly where we want Gamma to deliver.\n\nWhat excites you most tech-wise?\n\nAI and automation have huge potential, especially when they drive partner productivity and customer experience. But we’re also focused on making everyday adoption easier, packaging services better, embedding security by design and making it simpler to sell and support the full stack.\n\nYour proudest achievement?\n\nI’m proud of what we built at Pragma and EnableX, but what means the most to me are the relationships that have stood the test of time. Trust is the currency of this industry. Being the person someone still calls for advice or opportunity ten years later, that’s the real win.\n\nWhat would you change about the industry?\n\nI’d take out the complexity. There are way too many people who speak ‘tech’. Acronyms and techy words kill conversations with customers. We’ve also created layers that don’t always add value. What partners and customers want is clarity, flexibility and services that just work, and that’s what we need to focus on.\n\nToday’s top leadership priorities?\n\nStrong relationships. Also, listen deeply and invest in people and partnerships. The strongest leaders remove friction and build confidence. It’s not about having all the answers – it’s about being reliable, relevant, and ready to deliver."

        "cleaned_text": "New research from Virgin Media O2 Business reveals small and medium sized enterprise (SME) directors are experiencing more stress from technology, which is taking a significant toll on leaders’ mental health as a result.\n\nThe research of 2,000 small business owners, founders, MDs, and CEOs commissioned by Virgin Media O2 Business in support of World Wellbeing Week (24th – 30th June) highlights the impact of tech-related worries and multiple role responsibilities on SME leaders.\n\nTech-related stresses directly correlate to wellbeing declines affect 89%, with one-in-three (33%) SME leaders losing sleep at night over tech worries – and cybersecurity threats, data breaches, system crashes and technical failures are all cited as causes of significant stress (79%).\n\nKnowing the importance of unlocking technology benefits for SMEs, Virgin Media O2 Business has called on the SME community to share the tech load.\n\nAlongside this support, MSP and resellers can also help SMEs, stepping up to allow businesses focus on key issues.\n\nOther research findings showed that leaders also spend an average of 10 hours per working week on tasks outside of their expertise, and for the one in two (54%) SME leaders having to spend more time on unfamiliar tasks than those they’re trained for, the pressure to wear multiple hats is taking its toll.\n\nThe added workload is negatively affecting business owners and directors, with 76% saying it impacts their wellbeing, and 51% saying they are more stressed now compared to when they started their business.\n\nTo combat this rise in added workload, and to support SME leaders in finding the right solutions for their companies, Virgin Media has a technical advisory team with specialists in unified communications, WiFi solutions, data centre operations, cloud technologies, and cybersecurity, on hand to give expert advice and guidance.\n\nThis will help them make informed choices on the solutions that best fit their unique business needs, allowing leaders to focus on other priorities while alleviating tech stress.\n\nRoss Pearson, Head of Small Enterprise at Virgin Media O2 Business (pictured) commented: “Virgin Media O2 Business is here to act as a partner, not just a supplier for SMEs. We work with each customer to alleviate their tech stresses, acting as the tech experts so SME leaders can focus on taking the next step in their growth.”"

        "title": "Kaseya offers extended trials for MSPs",
        "cleaned_text": "Kaseya is rolling out a long-awaited demonstration programme, giving partners extended access to test new products before making licensing commitments.\n\nThe move, confirmed during the company’s flagship DattoCon Europe event in Dublin, marks a notable shift in its go-to-market approach and responds to demands from its MSP community to improve transparency, onboarding and customer support.\n\nHistorically, Kaseya partners were often required to license new tools without meaningful trial opportunities—an approach that some in the channel say has stifled confidence and adoption. “It was something that came up in discussion with Kaseya CEO Rania Succar (pictured),” said one UK-based partner at the event. “It was made clear that this would be extended to more products during the year —and it’s long overdue.”\n\nSpeaking to Comms Dealer sister firm IT Europa in Dublin, Kaseya CPO Jim Lippie confirmed the new initiative is being driven in direct response to partner feedback. “It’s a big piece of it,” he said. “People need the opportunity to properly evaluate these products. When they feel good about them, they will sign up.”\n\nLippie – who co-founded SaaS Alerts before joining Kaseya— – argued that rushed commitments often led to dissatisfaction: “If they buy it when they haven't fully evaluated it, and they sign a one or three year term, all they're going to be is upset. And that just creates negative feelings. It’s bad all the way around.”\n\nHe added that while some products already support limited trials, the new approach will expand coverage over time. “We’ve got 42 products… so you just can't wave a wand and change everything at once. But one thing you can do is be more flexible—and more partner-centric. That’s the overarching philosophy here now.”\n\nWhen asked about the structure of the new programme, Lippie acknowledged that it remains ad hoc for some product lines. “You will have to talk to a salesperson in some cases, and we can set up a free trial… I would categorise that piece of it as ad hoc, because it's not formalised. But again, all things we're going to be working towards.”\n\nHe confirmed that around five or six products are already included in the scheme, covering security, management, and reporting tools. While not yet extending to storage offerings—“to test storage, you have to put stuff in”—he said the roadmap includes bringing even the more complex VSA and backup products into trial mode. “We’re working on making trials more accessible,” he said.\n\nThe programme was one of several new initiatives designed to boost partner success under the leadership of Succar, who took on the role just weeks before the Dublin event.\n\nIn her keynote, Succar acknowledged the need to address concerns around support and product maturity: “Many of you have shared with me that you'd like to see us increase our investment in product, improving product quality and improving the integration benefits of the platform.”\n\nShe added: “You've shared that you'd like to see us become more customer-centric. That's exactly what you'll see in the next chapter of Kaseya.”\n\nSuccar outlined four new corporate values—prioritising customer outcomes, delivering meaningful innovation, enhancing the end-to-end experience, and building stronger community collaboration. “We'll measure our success based on your success—revenue growth, profitability improvement, the impact you're able to deliver to your end customers. Those will be our North Stars.”\n\nThe trial programme follows a broader uptick in engagement, according to multiple partners. “There has been an improvement, but it's still sluggish,” one said. “We’ve been told that these delays are something they want to address.”\n\nSuccar appeared to acknowledge the issue directly: “When we commit to doing something, we're going to deliver it on time,” she said. “We’re going to raise the bar in every experience you have with us—from billing to support to onboarding to product reliability.”\n\nKaseya also pledged to ramp up its European presence, which Succar described as its fastest-growing region. “We’re increasing our investment across Europe by hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming years,” she said. “We’re going to invest in engineers locally. We’re going to invest in local data centres and partner enablement.”\n\nWith DattoCon Europe 2025 hosting over 1,500 MSPs and technology vendors, Kaseya used the event to showcase new features across its unified platform—including AI-driven automation tools designed to simplify repetitive tasks and strengthen integration across its portfolio.\n\nSuccar concluded with a promise to maintain focus on delivery and accountability: “We're going to continue working to earn your trust every day by driving meaningful innovation, exceptional customer experiences, and working to deliver outcomes for you and your end customers.”"

        "cleaned_text": "Channel M&A is on an upward trajectory, driven by a key trend in particular that's intensifying, according to Knight Corporate Finance Director Paul Billingham.\n\n\"Across the market we have seen a downturn in deal activity, but our view is that the quality threshold for completed deals has been higher rather than acquirers pulling out of the market,\" he said. \"While the climate has been challenging over the last 12 months we have still seen good activity.\"\n\nAs well as raising the deal quality bar – rather than a dip in the number of active acquirers – another important factor is behind growing M&A momentum, noted Billingham who cited recent research conducted by Knight Corporate Finance.\n\n\"Buy and build is often associated with acquiring a company and slashing costs to increase profit, but our survey says that this is not the case,\" he explained.\n\n\"As the lines across different reseller channels blur, it is important for buyers to be competitive and acquiring new skills has been key in ensuring they can remain relevant to customers.\"\n\nBillingham noted that Knight has had a good year, having completed 17 deals in the last 12 months. And he says there is a high level of underlying confidence from acquirers in the comms and IT sectors, despite a relatively quiet start to 2025 for M&A.\n\n\"A combination of economic uncertainty, interest rates and higher taxation has resulted in a fall in deal volumes with the first quarter of the year recording the lowest number of deals for three years,\" he added.\n\n\"However, our research of over 30 buyers from across the MSP, communications and cloud services sector indicates that confidence remains strong with M&A still high on the agenda.\"\n\nResearch into the acquisition criteria for buyers revealed another telling trend, that building scale remains key with 24 per cent ranking increasing EBITDA as the most important factor.\n\n\"However, it is clear that acquiring for growth is proving more important than cost savings with 62 per cent of buyers citing organic growth, securing a position in a vertical market or expertise in a new technology as their main driver for a deal,\" added Billingham.\n\n\"Organic growth is the ultimate key value driver and ensuring teams have the right customer proposition is key to achieving this. It was also interesting and positive to note that 21 per cent of buyers told us that the quality of people was a key driver for making an acquisition.”\n\nThe research report went on to show that 77 per cent of the buyers questioned had completed at least one deal in the last year. Ninety three per cent were looking to complete an acquisition over the next 12 months, with 70 per cent seeking to close multiple deals.\n\nFurthermore, 83 per cent had debt facilities and/or sufficient cash to fund their deals. And 86 per cent are actively searching for the right acquisition.\n\n\"The remainder showed an intent to acquire but on a more opportunistic basis,\" added Billingham. “We are talking to buyers, funders and private equity investors on a daily basis and know that there is a strong appetite for M&A.”\n\nKnight Corporate Finance and sister company K3 Advantage are inviting MSP leaders to attend their Financial Sector M&A updates on July 8th, at London or Manchester (as part of UK Partner Week on July 3rd-10th organised by Comms Dealer publisher BPL Business Media).\n\nFind out more and register here -"

This has increased Zen’s combined business coverage to around 700 exchange areas.\n\nZen CEO Richard Tang said: “Our partnership with ITS allows us to extend our reach and provide connectivity solutions to our channel partners as well as B2B clients, especially in areas where we previously did not have a footprint.\n\n“I’m particularly happy about this being a reciprocal partnership, with Zen selling services over ITS’s network, and ITS using Zen’s network to provide services where ITS has not yet built network footprint.\"\n\nDavid Barber, Strategy Director, Zen Internet, added: “This agreement with ITS is a step forward in our mission to deliver greater choice, performance, and value to our channel partners and B2B customers.\n\n“With ITS, we’re unlocking new capabilities and geographies, and this is just the beginning. We have more partnerships on the horizon.”\n\nFollowing the interview, and during an interview with Tang, ITS CEO Daren Baythorpe revealed that ITS hopes to expand the reach of its network from 25% of UK businesses to 35% within the next 18-24 months."

        "cleaned_text": "Alongside the previously announced £11bn investment into the UK’s 5G infrastructure, VodafoneThree has shared more information on its post-merger roadmap, with work already underway to integrate the Three and Vodafone networks into one entity.\n\nThe new company will operate a multi-brand mobile strategy in consumer with Vodafone, Three, VOXI, SMARTY and Talkmobile remaining. Vodafone will be the only brand for business customers.\n\nOver the next 12 months, VodafoneThree will bring Three’s mobile broadband (Fixed Wireless Access1) together with Vodafone’s full fibre into one home broadband portfolio, under the Vodafone brand.\n\nVodafoneThree, plans to reach 99.95% 5G Standalone (5G SA) population coverage by 2034. The 5G SA build plan will be front-loaded so that by the end of the third year it will hit 90% population coverage from a current baseline of 47%.\n\nIt states that in one year, up to 50 million people will have access to VodafoneThree’s fastest 5G speeds.\n\nWithin two weeks, through the sharing of combined spectrum, seven million Three and SMARTY customers will receive a 4G boost of up to 20%.\n\nWithin a few months, 27 million Vodafone and Three mobile customers will start to benefit from access to roam on each other’s networks at no extra cost. It will happen automatically. By the end of the year this will remove a total of 16,500 sq/km of not spots with the first sites already having been turned on.\n\nBy this time next year, VodafoneThree will launch beta trials on space-based satellite mobile network through Vodafone’s partnership with AST Space Mobile.\n\nWithin two years the company will open two new customer care centres in Belfast and Sheffield, bringing 400 sales and customer service roles back to the UK, alongside the existing call centres in Stoke and Glasgow.\n\nVodafoneThree states that the deployment of 5G SA will lead to thousands more jobs in engineering, construction, and maintenance of telecom towers, fibre optics, and base stations. Over the entire eight-year build period, it believes it will create and sustain demand for, on average, 9,000 jobs, with peak investment years seeing as many as 13,000 jobs created across the UK (74% outside London and the south east).\n\nBy consolidating networks, VodafoneThree’s energy consumption will be around 31% lower than it would have been as two separate networks. In addition, VodafoneThree will reduce emissions from operations to net zero by 2027 and look to achieve the same across the full value chain by 2040.\n\nMax Taylor, CEO, VodafoneThree: “A new era of connectivity has begun. We will connect every nation, every community, in every corner of the UK. We will build the UK’s best 5G network with an unprecedented £11bn privately funded infrastructure project, laying the digital foundation for our country’s growth ambitions.\n\n“Benefits for our 27 million mobile customers will start within months, with access to roam across both networks at no extra cost. From big cities to small towns, and everywhere in between, our mission is to build the UK’s best network”."

This has been reflected in the last five years with the increase in our consumer footprint but we are now investing heavily to ensure that where we do roll out infrastructure, we connect all of the businesses that are available across that footprint.”\n\nCityFibre’s expansion is underpinned by its nationwide 10Gb XGS-PON technology upgrade, being rolled out across its FTTP network. The rollout incorporates Business Ethernet platform, designed to bring CityFibre’s full FTTP network online for its Business ISPs.\n\nNash shared that CityFibre aims to address 800,000 business premises in total. “We are in the trajectory for that target,” he said. “We have opportunities to scale our business footprint through organic infill by winning central government and BDUK contracts as well as adding an inorganic contribution through mergers and acquisitions.”\n\nIn the past year, CityFibre has worked with its partners to speed-up the installation of new business Ethernet connections by up to 40%.\n\nCityFibre seeks to drive market appetite by taking more of a partnership approach than would be seen on the consumer side, to ensure end-customers get connected. He said: “Our priority is to ensure that all our partners are underpinned with bespoke marketing campaigns and strategies that really commercialise the new footprint. From this base we will begin to innovate around the platform.”\n\nTo aid this, CityFibre has created a specialised business unit around its non-consumer verticals; business, government and mobile. Nash added: “These verticals require a special attention as the propositions and the solutioning is very different to what we do in the consumer space.\n\n“Developing that organisational rap around a discrete business unit is a key focus for us going forward.”"

        "cleaned_text": "Vendors are adding AI, video, SMS, CX and so much more to their UCaaS offering. Boil that down and that means voice is just one component. Stop focusing on just voice!\n\nThe ROI for UCaaS comes from the many components that a unified offering can replace like video conferencing, audio bridge, team chat, file share, and so much more. To really sell the value of Unified Comms, we need to break away from selling voice replacement.\n\nThe first word is Unified. The whole idea behind that was efficiency in having a single pane of glass for many forms of communications. Customer Experience and omni-channel take that to another level. Being able to see WhatsApp, social media, texts and more in a single window is the holy grail for very small businesses who have to have their coordinator work with six apps open all day. Now it can all flow to one window to make it efficient. This means we are affording the customer of time savings in minutes every day.\n\nThese are talking points to have with prospects and customers. Most customers may not know about the added functionality since they signed on. Most businesses have employee turn-over so the employees may be unaware of the many advantages of your service offering. Education is a vital part of sales and retention. We have to remember that what we are really selling is a Software Platform – and the myriad capabilities that flow from that. It is a full stack of software that includes voice, but goes far beyond that.\n\nBecause it is software, it can integrate with other software. These software integrations have increasingly improved and with AI will become an even bigger driver of productivity for many workers. Inputting data once and having it available across the workflow is a dream for workers.\n\nSellers normally forget to ask the buyer about software being used in the business. The discussion typically is around the voice and PBX. Those are table stakes of commodity sales. Helping a business leverage the many aspects of the platform to propel the digital transformation of the business moves the sales rep from a sales rep to a business advisor. That’s where the magic happens.\n\nTelling stories of how similar businesses took advantage of the platform will allow the buyer to see the possibility AND take a step away from PBX replacement. Remember that a key system buyer hasn’t shopped in over five years and the capabilities available to a small business now for $20 per user were unaffordable and unfathomable.\n\nMany sales reps even forget to discuss the mobility piece of UCaaS. Work from Anywhere is still a viable business strategy. Businesses – even small ones – have many employees who are not just remote but mobile or at least on the move. Having a mobile friendly platform to stay in the know and on top of things is one more productivity point to make.\n\nIt is really easy to get caught up in PBX and voice replacement in the sales process, but we are the experts on this software platform. Our job is to educate the buyer on the many ways that this software can enhance his business and improve productivity for the workers.\n\nDuring the sales process, you can have a discussion about the value of the platform and the outcomes that other businesses have derived from it or you can talk about the commodity component (voice), lower the price and hope for the best.\n\nFor further information visit:\n\nhttps://www.netsapiens.com/partners/"

This industry-led campaign marks a further step towards keeping people safe as we boost the resilience of our networks for the digital age.”"
