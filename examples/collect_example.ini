# Configuration for the generic web scraper.
#
# Add a new section for each news website you want to scrape.
# The section name (e.g., [BBC]) will be used as the 'source' in the output CSV.
#
# To find HTML selectors:
# 1. Open the website in your browser and right-click on an element you want to select (like an article link or title).
# 3. Choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element".
# 4. In the developer tools, right-click on the highlighted HTML element.
# 5. Go to "Copy" -> "Copy selector".
#
# Note: These selectors may change over time as websites update their design.
#
# e.g.
# [BBC]
# homepage = https://www.bbc.com/news
# # Selector for links that lead to articles from the homepage.
# article_link_selector = a[data-testid="internal-link"]
# # Selector for the main title of the article on the article page.
# title_selector = h1
# # Selector for the main content/body of the article.
# content_selector = div[data-component="text-block"]
