        "cleaned_text": "Some customers of mobile operator EE ( BT ), as well as those on other networks who might be trying to contact them, are currently experiencing a partial service outage that is disrupting their ability to make calls (others complain they also can’t receive calls). The operator has declared this to be a priority 1 incident. The issue also seems to be impacting some landline calls. The sporadic problem, which doesn’t seem to affect everybody, appears to have started at around 11am and will have also been felt by those on EE ’s virtual (MVNO) operators ( Spusu , Lyca Mobile etc.). The issue does not appear to be impacting Wi-Fi Calling, text messaging (SMS) or 4G and 5G data (mobile broadband) connections. A spokesperson for EE said: “ We’re currently addressing an issue impacting our services. We apologise for any inconvenience caused; we’re working urgently to fix this issue and will provide a further update as soon as possible .” Advertisement Calling problems on mobile operators can often be complex due to how call routing is handled and the issue of who actually controls your number – hint: it’s not always your current mobile operator ( try a network lookup ).

        "cleaned_text": "Residents in the tiny rural Gwynedd (Wales) village of Llangwnnadl have been left without access to fixed broadband and phone services for several weeks. Local news reports claim that the situation began after a telecoms pole replacement was carried out by Openreach , which is unusual as normally such work is carried out to fix and not cause a fault. According to the BBC News , the situation, which impacts around 40 homes across the small community, started on 4th July and is currently ongoing. Outdoor mobile coverage in the area appears to be quite variable, so it’s likely that some people may not be able to rely upon that as an alternative (experiences will vary between mobile providers and locations). Openreach has acknowledged how “ frustrating ” the issue is and said that their “ engineers are working to get everyone back up and running as quickly as possible “, albeit seemingly without providing any further details. ISPreview has also contacted the network operator in the hope of clarifying the unusual cause. Advertisement Openreach has previously informed ISPreview that it can take around 20 days to fix damaged poles, such as after a major storm. But over the years we’ve seen examples where, in rare cases of extreme damage, rural areas have been left to wait for several months before repairs ( here , here and here ). Such long waits can stem from a variety of issues, such as with the need to seek prior permission for traffic management, safety considerations and limited local resources etc. Resolving such problems in urban areas is normally a lot quicker and a downed pole can often be corrected within only a matter of hours or a few short days, but even these may be dependent upon some of the aforementioned caveats. We will update again once Openreach has responded. NOTE: Your comment may not appear instantly (it may take several hours) due to static caching and moderation checks by the anti-spam system.

        "title": "BDUK Issue First 2025 Update on UK Project Gigabit Broadband Progress",
        "cleaned_text": "The Government’s (DSIT) Building Digital UK agency has today published their first 2025 progress report on the £5bn Project Gigabit broadband rollout scheme, which covers the April to December 2024 period. The data reveals that some 1,188,400 UK premises have received gigabit-capable broadband coverage by BDUK’s gigabit programmes since their inception. At present around 88% of UK premises can already access a gigabit-capable network ( here ) and Ofcom separately forecasts that this could hit around 97% by May 2027 ( here ). Most of this has been delivered by commercial deployments (predominantly focused on urban and semi-urban areas), but there are some areas in the final 10-20% of premises that are simply too expensive for commercial providers to tackle. NOTE: The project is technology neutral, although Fibre-to-the-Premises ( FTTP ) remains the preferred solution. Project Gigabit itself was originally established in 2021 to help extend broadband ISP networks capable of delivering download speeds of at least 1000Mbps (1Gbps), and uploads of at least 200Mbps, to achieve “ nationwide ” coverage (c.99%) by 2030 2032 ( here ) – focusing on the commercially unviable areas (usually rural and semi-rural locations). The project has already committed most of its budget up to 2030, but there are still some contracts yet to be awarded and others that have failed or been scaled-back ( here , here and here ). Advertisement The project primarily consists of several support schemes, including the Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme (£210m), funding to extend Dark Fibre around the public sector (£110m) and gap-funded deployments with suppliers (mostly the rest of funding) – known as the Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy (GIS) programme. However, the progress reports on this scheme have, over the past year or so, become gradually less and less detailed (they also used to be published on a quarterly basis). The latest one follows this trend, but we do get a fair bit of detail in the spreadsheet, even if there seem to be no updates on Project Gigabit’s future contract pipeline. Overall, BDUK sestimate that their interventions delivered 113,700 premises with gigabit-capable broadband coverage between 1st April 2024 and 31st December 2024. In total this means that a cumulative estimate of 1,188,400 premises have received gigabit-capable coverage via BDUK’s gigabit programmes since their inception. Of the premises delivered by BDUK between 1 April 2024 and 31 December 2024: Advertisement Take note that BDUK count both directly subsidised premises as well as uncommercial premises that were not directly funded but received connections as a result of nearby BDUK funded projects. “ As a result, all premises passed figures are estimates based on a combination of raw supplier data and modelled estimates ,” said BDUK. The spreadsheets also include some additional data and a regional breakdown of the figures, as well as by each contract, which we’ve included below. One key thing to note below is that Project Gigabit itself has still only delivered a relatively small amount of gigabit coverage, with the earlier ‘ Superfast Broadband Programme ‘ (SFBB) still holding the lion’s share.

        "cleaned_text": "Mobile operator O2 ( Virgin Media ) and network technology provider Ontix have this morning announced that they’ve enhanced 4G mobile (mobile broadband) capacity in the city of Bristol in South West England, specifically the historic Clifton area, by extending their deployment of several small cells. Small cells are mini shoebox sized mobile (radio) base stations, which are designed to deliver limited coverage (usually up to around 100 metres) and thus tend to be more focused on busy urban areas and specific sites – it’s not uncommon to find these sitting on top of lampposts, CCTV poles or old payphone cubicles (i.e. they can be more cost-effective than building new street assets or trying to secure wayleaves on buildings etc.). The latest project follows similar small call deployments in other large towns and cities across the UK (e.g. London, Birmingham, Reading, Cambridge, Plymouth and Chester). In this case, O2 and Ontix have partnered to deploy them in some of the busiest areas across Clifton, including around the University of Bristol’s key buildings, the iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge visitor centre, and popular shopping and dining areas. Advertisement Dr Rob Joyce, Director of Mobile Access Engineering at VMO2, said: “Our Mobile Transformation Plan will see us invest £700m into our mobile network this year to ensure our customers consistently receive an exceptional network experience wherever they are and even at the busiest times. Small cells are an important part of this investment, offering an effective way to provide a local network boost to keep up with rising customer demand. Clifton Suspension Bridge is one of the most iconic locations in the country and customers can now benefit from a more reliable network when visiting this local landmark.” NOTE: Your comment may not appear instantly (it may take several hours) due to static caching and moderation checks by the anti-spam system.

        "title": "VodafoneThree UK Hits 1.65 Million Broadband Users as Mobile Tops 28.76m UPDATE",
        "cleaned_text": "Broadband and mobile operator Vodafone has published their first combined Q1 FY26 financial results with Three UK . The figures show that the merged entity has 1.654 million fixed broadband customers (up by 44k in Q1 vs 61k in the previous quarter) and a huge combined mobile base of 28.765m – making them the “ biggest mobile network operator in the UK “. In terms of their fixed broadband services, Vodafone reported more growth, with a quarterly addition of 44,000 customers – thanks in part to being widely available across both Openreach ’s and CityFibre ’s national networks. The provider’s full fibre ( FTTP ) coverage can now reach a combined total of 20.3 million UK households (up from 19.4m last quarter). As for their mobile base, the combined operator reported a quarterly fall of -46,000 in Pay Monthly customers (vs an increase of 41,000 in Q4) and there was another fall of -235,000 in Prepaid / PAYG customers (vs -166k in Q4). Finally, quarterly mobile broadband (data) usage across their UK network increased to 722,621 TeraBytes (up from 655,568 TB last quarter). Advertisement However, it’s important to remember that the prior quarter’s results reflect a pre-merger structure and so may not make for a useful apples-to-apples comparison this time around, since Vodafone now has to consider the impact of Three UK ’s base. The results also include an update on some of their initial merger benefits: “ Within just two weeks, through sharing of combined spectrum, 7 million Three and SMARTY customers have benefitted from improving 4G speeds by up to 40%. Within a few months, 28.8 million Vodafone and Three UK customers will start to benefit from seamlessly using both networks. By the end of the year this will remove a total of 16,500 km2 of ‘not spot’ areas ,” said Vodafone ( future plans and extra detail ). NOTE: The Data usage figure above represents the sum of downlink and uplink traffic, all APNs (e.g. web, wap, corporate APNs, MMS), femto traffic (if applicable), inbound roamers and MVNOs – excluding data resulting from voice over LTE traffic. Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group CEO, said: “We have had a good start to the year with strong revenue and EBITDAaL growth. Germany has started its improvement trajectory and our emerging markets are delivering strong broad-based growth. In the UK, we have completed the merger with Three and are moving quickly to combine our networks to benefit customers. Today, we reiterate our full year guidance of growth in profit and cash flow. After two years of transformation and change, Vodafone is now well positioned for multi-year growth across both Europe and Africa.” Finally, the operator saw their quarterly UK service revenue reach €1,646m (up from €1,489m in the previous quarter). The full report is here (PDF). UPDATE 11:01am Advertisement Vodafone has provided a little bit more detail on the progress of that 4G speed increase. The average speed increase is actually 20% (only some users have seen data speeds reaching up to 40% faster) and the enhanced performance has been made possible by activating an extra 5MHz of 1800MHz spectrum on almost 15,000 sites of the Three UK network. Speed improvements will of course differ from location to location, depending on how each site is set up. The biggest boosts will be seen in areas that had less capacity before. For example, Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, has recently received a 40% uplift in 4G speed courtesy of the additional radio spectrum. VodafoneThree engineers worked around the clock since the merger’s completion to activate the additional spectrum. Three UK sites in Kent and Sussex were among the first to experience the speed boost, with the rollout quickly expanding nationwide and concluding with final upgrades in Scotland.

        "title": "BT See Loss of 169k Openreach UK Broadband Lines and Appoints New CFO",
        "cleaned_text": "Telecoms giant BT Group just published a short trading update to the end June 2025 (Q1 FY26), which reveals that Openreach lost another 169,000 total broadband lines to rival networks over the past quarter (down from 243k in the previous quarter). But they also saw their “ full fibre ” ( FTTP ) coverage grow to over 19 million premises (up by 1m) and take-up increased to 37% (up from 36.13%). Firstly, our usual reminder that the BT Group now only publishes a short trading update during calendar Q1 and Q3, thus we only get a very limited summary this time around – the full half-yearly reports come in Q2 and Q4. As such, we’ve opted to do a similarly brief update on the key details below. NOTE: Openreach are investing up to £15bn to bring FTTP to 25 million premises by December 2026 (80%+ of the UK) and they hold an ambition to reach up to 30 million by 2030. In terms of the other headline changes, BT today announced that Simon Lowth will retire as their Group CFO, with Patricia Cobian appointed as successor. Patricia is currently still Virgin Media and O2 ’s (VMO2) chief financial officer (since 2021), but has now been poached by the BT Group. She will thus join the BT Group Board and its Executive Committee in the summer of next year (2026). Advertisement Otherwise, on those broadband line losses, at the start of 2025 Openreach noted that around 80% of those had come from areas where they haven’t yet deployed their new FTTP network (i.e. copper-based ADSL and hybrid fibre FTTC broadband and phone-only lines). This underlines the importance of Openreach’s rapid roll-out, but it also highlights the importance of a first-mover advantage for altnets in targeting those areas. However, despite the negatives, BT’s CEO can probably still feel reasonably confident of the operator’s direction, particularly after having somewhat succeeded in getting the stock market to better recognise the value of the fibre they now have in the ground ( here and here ). The group’s share price has gone from around 140p in January 2025 to around 200p this morning. Nevertheless, there’s still a long way to go, and many uncertainties remain about how today’s market will evolve over the next few years, particularly with respect to consolidation. But the relative fibre build stagnation among many altnets and Virgin Media ’s ( O2 ) unexpected build slowdown ( here ) does tend to give BT more of an edge than they’ve had for a while. BT’s CEO, Allison Kirkby, said: “BT has had a solid start to the year, with our full fibre broadband now reaching more than 19 million homes and businesses and our 5G network available to over 87% of the UK population. We’re seeing strong customer demand for our next-generation broadband and mobile connectivity across all our brands, with record Openreach fibre take-up again this quarter. And we’re delivering on our transformation, as we radically simplify our business while improving customer experience. BT is investing more than anyone else in the nation’s networks, we’re connecting customers faster, and we’re on track to deliver our targets for this year, next year, and the end of the decade – creating a better BT, for all of us.” As usual, it’s worth contrasting the latest results against BT’s future targets for 2030, which among other things have predicted that their total labour force would shrink to between 75,000 and 90,000 (i.e. many of the engineers they have today won’t be needed post-2030) and FTTP coverage would grow to between 25-30 million premises, while delivering take-up of around 40-55% (this will grow even faster once the roll-out pace slows). Advertisement BT also holds a target of 13.0-14.5 million retail 5G mobile connections via EE , and today’s update reports that they’ve already reached 13.5m, up 12% year-on-year. BT Group’s June 2025 Performance Summary ➤ More than 1m premises passed with FTTP for a sixth consecutive quarter, at an average build rate of 81k per week, on track to achieve up to 5m this fiscal year; FTTP footprint reached more than 19m premises, of which 5.2m in rural locations ➤ Record customer demand for Openreach FTTP with net adds up 46% year-on-year to 566k; total premises connected 7.1m, increasing our market-leading take up rate to 37%; Hyperoptic has entered into a wholesale agreement with Openreach, further extending its national footprint; Openreach broadband ARPU up 4% to £16.6, driven by higher FTTP take-up, speed mix and price increases ➤ Openreach broadband lines fell by 169k, driven by losses to competitors and a weaker broadband market; our full year expectation remains unchanged from that given in May ➤ Retail FTTP base grew by 32% year-on-year to 3.7m of which Consumer 3.4m and Business 0.3m; 5G base reached 13.5m, up 12% year-on-year ➤ Consumer customer base grew in the quarter, with broadband base up 11k and postpaid mobile base up 41k; Consumer broadband ARPU2 down 2% year-on-year to £41.9 and postpaid mobile ARPU2 of £19.4 broadly flat year-on-year, and we continue to expect a similar seasonal growth pattern as FY25; Consumer fixed and mobile convergence grew to 25.5% from 24.6% last quarter; EE proud to be sponsors of the Lionesses as they head towards the UEFA Euro 2025 final ➤ Business adjusted UK service revenue down 2%, stable excluding traditional voice; EBITDA pressure was mainly in the international segment; Business will be reported as two separate customer-facing units from Q2 FY26 for our UK and International operations ➤ Cost transformation delivered efficiencies across all units, fully offsetting higher employer costs of National Living Wage and National Insurance: year-on-year energy usage in our networks was down 5%, total labour resource was down 5% to 113k and Openreach repair volumes were down 14% ➤ BT Group NPS of 30.4, up 5.6pts year-on-year, with improved customer experience across all our customer facing units On track to achieve full year guidance: ➤ Reported and adjusted revenue1 £4.9bn, down 3% year-on-year mainly due to weaker handset sales in Consumer and continued challenging international trading, offsetting the benefit of FTTP growth in Openreach and price increases; Adjusted UK service revenue1 £3.9bn, down 1%, largely due to the seasonal impact of price changes in Consumer and traditional voice in Business ➤ Adjusted EBITDA1 £2.1bn, down 1% with adverse revenue offset by strong cost transformation ➤ Reported profit before tax of £468m, down 10% primarily due to an increase in net finance costs and depreciation and amortisation NOTE: Your comment may not appear instantly (it may take several hours) due to static caching and moderation checks by the anti-spam system.

        "cleaned_text": "Rural UK broadband operator Voneus , which continues to deploy a gigabit-capable fixed wireless access (FWA) and full fibre ( FTTP ) networks across poorly served rural areas, has announced that they’ve deployed their wireless network across the small Carmarthenshire (Wales) town of St. Clears. At present St. Clears is home to around 3,200 people and, in only 90 days since the first build, Voneus has managed to deploy a gigabit wireless network in the area. The new network appears to harness Cambium Networks’ 60GHz cnWave mesh technology, which is the same solution they’ve used in other areas too. NOTE: Voneus previously received investments from Macquarie Capital, the Israel Infrastructure Fund (IIF) and Tiger Infrastructure Partners (principal shareholder of Rural Broadband Solutions) etc. The operator originally aspired to cover 370,000 UK premises via their gigabit-capable networks, but they’ve so far done 100,000 (18th Feb 2025). The rapid deployment is also said to have only been possible thanks to the operator’s close collaboration with Carmarthenshire County Council, which took a proactive approach. “ Their support was instrumental from start to finish and the Council’s broadband engagement lead played a vital role in helping us navigate local processes and ensure a smooth, efficient rollout ,” said a spokesperson for Voneus. Advertisement Residential customers of the service typically pay from £38.99 per month for a 250Mbps (symmetric) speed service on a 24-month term (first month free and free installation), which rises to £74.99 for their top 900Mbps package. But it should be said that Openreach ’s rival full fibre ( FTTP ) network also reaches some properties in the town and is due to cover more of the area in the near future. The company’s most recent accounts, which cover the year to 31st March 2024, reveal that turnover has increased by 34% to £4.417m, while gross profit shrank by -17% to £768.6k and total employees grew from 156 to 238. But the latter doesn’t take account of the recent redundancies and build slowdown ( here ). The company’s loss before tax has also more than doubled to £36.65m (up from £14.83m), although their net assets have grown to be worth £93.43m (up from £23.32m).

        "cleaned_text": "Broadband ISP and network builder Exascale, which has also deployed their own gigabit speed Fibre-to-the-Premises ( FTTP ) network to a few thousands premises in part of Telford and Wrekin, has today signed a partnership to harness CityFibre ’s network and thus deliver FTTP and Ethernet services to more UK homes and businesses. CityFibre ’s network currently covers around 4.5 million premises (inc. 550k customers) and they’ve long aspired to reach up to 8 million UK premises – representing c.30% of the UK. The new deal means that, with “ immediate effect “, Exascale will be able to start offering gigabit-speed broadband and high-capacity Ethernet access via this network too. One of the most powerful outcomes of this partnership is the ability for Exascale’s existing channel partners to gain overnight access to CityFibre’s extensive UK footprint, without delay or additional infrastructure investment. The move also comes shortly after CityFibre unveiled a major new funding agreement worth £2.3bn to help drive their expansion ( here ). Advertisement Thomas Bibb, CEO of Exascale, said: “At Exascale, our mission has always been to provide fast and dependable connectivity across the UK. Partnering with CityFibre enables us to dramatically accelerate our full fibre rollout and bring world-class broadband to even more businesses and homes. We’re especially excited about the opportunity this brings to our channel community, who can now deliver services across CityFibre’s network instantly. This is a major leap forward for everyone involved.” Ollie Moore, Account Manager at CityFibre, said: “We’re excited to welcome Exascale to our partner ecosystem. Their deep technical expertise and commitment to customer satisfaction align strongly with our mission to transform the UK’s digital infrastructure. Together, we’re opening up new possibilities for partners and customers nationwide.” Before pressing publish on this article we did attempt to test a couple of CityFibre postcodes via Exascale’s website, but both returned no positive results. So the effect may not be quite “ immediate ” for every part of Exascale’s platform. We should add that this is a one-way agreement and CityFibre are not gaining any reciprocal access to Exascale’s own fibre.

At present spusu already offers limited free EU roaming across 38 countries (a fair usage cap applies to these), but roaming outside of those countries is still charged at the assigned rate specified in the operator’s most recent price guide .

This means it now costs £4 per GigaByte (GB) of data to roam in popular holiday hotspots such as Turkey, the United States, Australia, Thailand and Singapore, and £7 per GigaByte to roam in Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico and Philippines. Advertisement One key difference here is that spusu previously priced by the MegaByte, rather than GigaByte (1024MB = 1GB). For example, back in June somebody travelling to Turkey would have paid £0.010 per MegaByte, thus 1GB of data usage would have cost you £10.24, and today it’s £4. This is not the cheapest for 1GB and eSIM Travel providers can beat that (heck you can get 1GB for free from Airalo), but it’s a big improvement on the old charges. Christian Banhans, UK MD of spusu, said: “The revised roaming pricing structure significantly enhances value for UK customers travelling abroad. Since launching in the UK in 2023, we’ve been committed to breaking down barriers for our customers. And with these changes, we’re ensuring our customers can travel further, worry less and enjoy more of what matters.” In addition, to protect users from surprise bills, spusu recommends using their in-app spending cap, which prevents customers from exceeding their plans data allowance and facing additional charges. Users can adjust their caps from £0-100 in the ‘my spusu’ app, which also tracks usage and spending in real time. Spusu tracks usage in KiloBytes, which they say offers “ better value and making sure that customers are only charged for what they use “.

        "title": "Vodafone UK Improves Customer Support with “Just Ask Once” Service",
        "cleaned_text": "Broadband and mobile provider Vodafone (VodafoneThree) has today launched a new service called ‘ Just Ask Once ‘, which will essentially see “ one person deal with a customer’s query from start to finish, until it is sorted “. The operator claims this will mean no more waiting on hold, no more transfers between agents and no more repeating yourself. The goal of this seems to be to remove “ well-known bug bears such as waiting on hold, repeating the problem to multiple different people, and the need to chase for an update “. Instead of that, customers can load up the feature via the MyVodafone app and respond to messages when it’s convenient. In fairness, this is how a lot of online support / ticket systems already work, but Vodafone claims to be going further by ensuring that related requests are handled by the same agent. If the query can’t be resolved straight away, the same person from Vodafone will proactively message the customer with updates until it is solved. But if, after all that, they still can’t provide the service they’ve promised, then “ customers can leave with no exit fee “. Advertisement Rob Winterschladen, Consumer Director of VodafoneThree, said: “When it comes to customers, our ambition is simple: we want to be the best. We want to set the gold standard for customer service and that’s why we’re launching ‘Just Ask Once’. ’Just Ask Once’ is based on a really simple principle: when a customer needs help, they ask us once, and we will sort it. Customers can simply and quickly message us through the My Vodafone app at any time and importantly, they’ll only deal with one person until their query is sorted. There’s no more waiting on hold, no transfers between agents, and no more repeating themselves – allowing customers to get on with their day, while we get on with solving their problem. If we can’t resolve a query immediately, we’ll proactively message the customer with updates until it is sorted, so they aren’t left worrying or having to chase us. What’s more, if we exhaust all avenues and can’t provide the service we promised, then we will let them leave with no exit fee. ‘Just Ask Once’ will level-up customer care and give our customers the most convenient and reliable support in the market.” The idea of essentially having a dedicated manager for a specific issue or account is not a new one, although it’s usually considered more of a feature applied to more expensive business connections and not residential ones. This is because maintaining the assignment of a specific agent to a specific customer can be quite tricky and isn’t always the most cost-efficient way of using support staff. The announcement doesn’t say it, but we strongly suspect Vodafone may be making use of AI and automation for this system to be viable at the consumer level. In that sense, a lot of the updates may end up coming from a computer rather than a human, since automation can be used to tackle a lot of the more laborious elements in this sort of process. But that’s just our speculation. However, despite the PR spin about not being passed to different agents, Vodafone does say in the small print that some queries may require a “ specialist team ” (i.e. not your assigned agent). For example, if your query relates to a complex technical issue or home broadband premises/move, Vodafone will direct you to this other team over the phone. For customers who are in debt, the collections team will handle your query. ‘Just Ask Once’ is also available for small office/home office (SOHO) business customers with 1-9 employees via the same app. Customers who don’t want to contact Vodafone customer service using the My Vodafone app can of course still get help by calling 191 on their mobile or through the Vodafone website.

        "cleaned_text": "Over the years we’ve seen various different uses for wireless WiFi signals being developed, such as the ability to see through walls ( here ) or to act as a motion sensing alarm system ( here ). Now a team of Italian researchers have figured out how to identify individual people by the biometric identifier they give off when walking through Wi-Fi signals. According to a new research paper from a team at the La Sapienza University of Rome, the Wi-Fi Sensing method they’ve developed – called ‘ WhoFi ‘ – can essentially identify people based on the way that their bodies interfere with Wi-Fi signals as they pass through an area. “ The core insight is that as a Wi-Fi signal propagates through an environment, its waveform is altered by the presence and physical characteristics of objects and people along its path. These alterations, captured in the form of Channel State Information (CSI), contain rich biometric information ,” said the paper. “ Unlike optical systems that perceive only the outer surface of a person, Wi-Fi signals interact with internal structures, such as bones, organs, and body composition, resulting in person-specific signal distortions that act as a unique signature .” Advertisement In addition, and rather unlike existing visual ID systems (cameras etc.), Wi-Fi based ID systems are not affected by changes in visual illumination, can penetrate walls and occlusions, and also “ offer a privacy-preserving mechanism for sensing ” (i.e. you don’t need a visual picture of somebody). Summary from the Research Paper Person Re-Identification is a key and challenging task in video surveillance. While traditional methods rely on visual data, issues like poor lighting, occlusion, and suboptimal angles often hinder performance. To address these challenges, we introduce WhoFi, a novel pipeline that utilizes Wi-Fi signals for person re-identification. Biometric features are extracted from Channel State Information (CSI) and processed through a modular Deep Neural Network (DNN) featuring a Transformer-based encoder. The network is trained using an in-batch negative loss function to learn robust and generalizable biometric signatures. Experiments on the NTU-Fi dataset show that our approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness in identifying individuals via Wi-Fi signals. The research paper itself should be considered more of a starting point for further development, which proves that the concept may finally be viable. The next step will be to turn theory into a practical solution that works outside the lab. We should point out that the idea above has been experimentally researched before, but accuracy was a big problem, and the new paper largely seems to solve this issue.

        "cleaned_text": "Matthew Hare, the Executive Chairman of alternative UK broadband operator FullFibre Limited , has announced that he is “ stepping back ” from the role after only being appointed to the post in January 2025 following the merger with fellow altnet Zzoomm ( here ), where he was previously the CEO. The combined Fibre-to-the-Premises ( FTTP ) network currently reaches 600,000 premises (RFS) and 80,000 customers (up from 70k in March 2025) across England – serving parts of 100 market towns, which makes it one of the UK’s largest altnets. This reflects both their open access wholesale network (FullFibre) and their in-house retail ISPs ( BeFibre and Zzoomm ), although the BeFibre brand might soon be retired ( here ). NOTE: Zzoomm was originally supported by £224m in capital = £100m debt via banks ( here ), £12m from private investors (“ big chunk ” of that comes from Matthew Hare) and £112m via Oaktree Capital ( here ). By comparison, FullFibre Ltd was backed by investment from Basalt Infrastructure Partners LLP . The newly merged company has since suffered from some post-deal redundancies ( here ), although the big development this week is that the former CEO of Zzoomm and current Executive Chairman of the merged network, Matthew Hare (pictured – left), has informed shareholders that he is stepping back from the role, despite only doing the job for a few months. Advertisement James Warner, CEO of FullFibre (Group), said: “Matthew Hare has made the decision to step down from his role of Executive Chairman from the FullFibre/Zzoomm group. His development of the highly respected Zzoomm business, and most recently in his role supporting the newly enlarged FullFibre group, have played a critical role in building competitive UK telecoms infrastructure providing high quality services to customers across the country. The board thank him for his efforts and wish him all the best in his future endeavours.” According to ISPreview’s sources, Matthew is also understood to have indicated that the network operator is in sight of positive EBITDA this year and positive cash flow next year. The group is said to be considering a range of additional merger opportunities that could potentially help to grow their current level of profitability and cash generation even faster. Matthew doesn’t say precisely why he’s chosen to step back from the new role and all day-to-day operations, but he does plan to remain a minority shareholder in the business and indicated strong confidence in the company’s CEO, James Warner (pictured – right). Matthew added that he himself doesn’t have any immediate plans and is currently contemplating his future.

        "title": "Netomnia Expand FTTP Broadband Coverage to 2.56 Million UK Premises",
        "cleaned_text": "Alternative network operator Netomnia ( Brsk , Youfibre ) has today published their Q2 2025 results, which reveals that their multi-gigabit speed Fibre-to-the-Premises ( FTTP ) broadband network now covers 2.56 million UK premises (up 243k in the quarter) and is home to 341,000 customers (up 54k). The results mean that the operator is still on-track for their current coverage goals and EBITDA positivity in 2025. Netomnia continues to expand their network coverage by around 1 million premises per year, and they expect to reach 3 million premises by the end of 2025 and then 5 million by the end of 2027 (inc. 1 million customers by 2028). The service is currently available across parts of over 90 UK cities and towns. NOTE: The combined group of Netomnia and Brsk is backed by around £1.5bn of equity and debt from investors Advencap, DigitalBridge, and Soho Square Capital etc. In addition, Netomnia’s take-up rate has increased by one percentage point during the first quarter, going from 12.4% in Q1 to 13.4% in Q2. This is particularly positive given the operator’s rapid rate of build, which normally has a tendency to suppress the percentage growth in take-up (i.e. building to many more premises than the rate of customer adoption). Advertisement The brief results also reveal that the operator delivered £23.6m in quarterly revenue (up from £19.9m in Q1 and 256% year-on-year) and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of (£4.9m) – up 30% YoY, the latter of which excludes exceptional items. But the ongoing network builds inevitably mean that Net Debt has also grown to £709m (up 16% Quarter-on-Quarter from £610m – debt drawn to date including accrued interest less cash). Jeremy Chelot, Group CEO of Netomnia, YouFibre and brsk, said: “We now have the fastest network build and customer acquisition rate among Alt-Nets. We’re on track to reach 3 million premises passed and achieve EBITDA positivity in 2025. With plans to scale to 5 million premises by 2027, we remain the UK’s most scaled and capital-efficient retail and wholesale platform, positioned to lead industry consolidation.” The question of consolidation remains an interesting one for a network operator in Netomnia’s position, not least because it may require additional investment in order to deliver any deals of scale, and they might then find themselves battling against CityFibre and Nexfibre ( Virgin Media ) for some of the same players. On the other hand, DigitalBridge also backs Freedom Fibre and the two have very little overbuild (the networks are also very close together – complementary), which could be one potential target. Jeremy Chelot’s former haunt of CommunityFibre in London might be another possibility, although that would require a serious funding agreement, but the two do have a somewhat complementary approach to build and no overbuild. Some other options might be MS3 , Trooli and a few others. Time will tell.

        "cleaned_text": "Weaker handset sales and challenging trading conditions contribute to decline. BT Group’s adjusted revenue declined 3 per cent to £4.9 billion in the first quarter to 30 June 2025 from £5.1 billion a year earlier. That was due to weaker consumer handset sales and continued challenging international trading conditions offsetting its Openreach FTTP growth and price increases, according to its trading update for the three months to 30 June 2025. The company’s business adjusted revenue also fell 6 per cent to £1.8 billion from £1.9 billion over the same period. Despite its business adjusted UK service revenue being down 2 per cent, it remained stable, excluding traditional voice. Adjusted UK service also declined 1 per cent to £3.9 billion, largely due to the seasonal impact of prices changes in its consumer segment and traditional voice in its business segment. Added to that, BT’s reported profit before tax fell 10 per cent to £468 million, primarily due to an increase in net finance costs and depreciation and amortisation. Its adjusted EBITDA was also down 1 per cent at £2.1 billion as adverse revenue was offset by string cost transformation. However, BT also reported that more than 1 million premises were passed with FTTP for a sixth consecutive quarter, at an average build rate of 81,000 per week, on track to achieve up to 5 million this fiscal year. Overall, the company’s FTTP footprint reached more than 19 million premises, of which 5.2 million were in rural locations. Net adds for Openreach FTTP were also up 46 per cent yoy to 566,000, with total premises connected standing at 7.1 million. Additionally, Openreach increased its take up rate to 37 per cent, while its broadband ARPU increased 4 per cent to £16.6, driven by higher FTTP take-up, speed mix and price increases. However, Openreach’s broadband lines fell by 169,000, driven by losses to competitors and a weaker broadband market. Conversely, BT’s retail FTTP base grew by 32 per cent yoy to 3.7 million, of which consumer accounted for 3.4 million and business 300,000. Its 5G base also reached 13.5 million, up 12 per cent yoy. Allison Kirkby, chief executive of BT Group, said, “BT has had a solid start to the year, with our full fibre broadband now reaching more than 19 million homes and businesses, and our 5G network available to over 87 per cent of the UK population. We’re seeing strong customer demand for our next-generation broadband and mobile connectivity across all our brands, with record Openreach fibre take-up again this quarter. And we’re delivering on our transformation, as we radically simplify our business while improving customer experience. “BT is investing more than anyone else in the nation's networks, we’re connecting customers faster, and we're on track to deliver our targets for this year, next year, and the end of the decade - creating a better BT, for all of us.” Separately, BT has appointed Patricia Cobian as group chief financial officer, replacing Simon Louth, who will be stepping down after nine years in the role. Cobian is currently CFO at Virgin Media O2. She will join the BT Group board and executive committee in the summer of 2026, with Louth retiring following a managed handover."

The company also grew its group service revenue by 5.3 per cent to €7.9 billion over the same period as higher revenue from the consolidation of Three UK was offset by foreign exchange movements, according to its Q1 FY26 trading update. On an organic basis, service revenue rose 5.5 per cent (Q4: 5.4 per cent), with growth across all segments apart from the UK. Organic service revenue was also up 0.9 per cent (Q4: 3.1 per cent), with growth in its consumer and wholesale segments offset by a decline in its business segment due to planned managed services contract terminations. Additionally, its business organic service revenue grew by 4 per cent (Q4: 5.1 per cent), primarily driven by the strong demand for digital services across Europe and Africa. Group adjusted EBITDAaL also increased by 4.9 per cent on an organic basis to €2.7 billion, as service revenue growth in most markets was partially offset by the impact of the TV law change in Germany and continued commercial investments. However, at the same time, Vodafone’s operating profit decreased by 34.3 per cent to €1 billion. Margherita Della Valle, group chief executive of Vodafone, said, “We have had a good start to the year with strong revenue and EBITDAaL growth. Germany has started its improvement trajectory and our emerging markets are delivering strong broad-based growth. In the UK, we have completed the merger with Three and are moving quickly to combine our networks to benefit customers. “Today, we reiterate our full year guidance of growth in profit and cash flow. After two years of transformation and change, Vodafone is now well positioned for multi-year growth across both Europe and Africa.”"

        "cleaned_text": "Clumio Backtrack enables teams to revert Amazon DynamoDB tables to prior point without reconfiguration. Commvault has announced the general availability of Clumio Backtrack for Amazon DynamoDB. Amazon DynamoDB has become a foundational technology for cloud-first development teams, especially those building high-scale, latency-sensitive applications such as real-time personalisation engines, e-commerce platforms, mobile apps and AI-driven services. Clumio Backtrack for DynamoDB enables teams to almost instantly revert existing DynamoDB tables to a prior point in time with no reconfiguration necessary. Organisations can also recover individual partitions versus entire tables, cutting both recovery times and recovery costs. This approach, combined with an ‘incremental forever’ backup model, not only helps deliver fast, precise recovery, but also can lower total cost of ownership compared to native options that only offer full backups. “Organisations are building their next-generation cloud and AI applications on DynamoDB,” said Woon Jung, chief technology officer, cloud native at Commvault. “Clumio Backtrack removes the friction and risk from database recovery. Now, teams can roll back or restore their data in minutes, not days, and without needing to perform complex, multi-step manual recoveries. This is another example of Commvault leading the charge in resilience and recovery.” Archana Venkatraman, senior research director, cloud data management at IDC, said, “Amazon DynamoDB remains a critical cloud-native NoSQL database in production, thanks to major improvements across consistency, cost and performance. Amid rising data resilience and availability imperatives, precise, point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB is a significant advancement. This granular control reduces downtime, risks and operational costs, key needs for agile development and AI-driven applications.”"

Openreach has announced a further 137 new exchange locations, covering 854,000 premises across the UK, where the business plans to stopping selling legacy analogue services. The business is giving communication providers, such as BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone, that use its network, one year’s notice that it will no longer be selling legacy analogue products and services where full fibre becomes available to a majority (more than 75 per cent) of premises in these new exchange locations. Stop sell is triggered when a majority (75 per cent) of premises connected to a particular exchange can get full fibre. Customers who then want to switch, upgrade or re-grade their broadband or phone service will have to take a new digital service over Openreach’s new full fibre network. Customers in these exchanges not yet able to receive full fibre at their premises won't be impacted and can stay on their existing copper-based service until full fibre becomes available. By 19 August, stop sell rules will have been activated in 1,041 exchanges across the UK – meaning that 8.9 million premises will be under active stop sell – i.e. premises where full fibre is available to a majority of premises and copper products cannot be sold – equal to 46.4 per cent of Openreach’s total full fibre footprint. James Lilley, Openreach’s managed customer migrations manager, said, “The stop sell programme is a critical part of ensuring that the UK's communication infrastructure is ready to meet the demands of the future. “Taking advantage of the progress of our full fibre build and encouraging people to upgrade where a majority can access our new network is the right thing to do as it makes no sense, both operationally and commercially, to keep the old copper network and our new fibre network running side-by-side. “As copper’s ability to support modern communications declines, the immediate focus is getting people onto newer, future-proofed technologies.”"

LoopUp has been selected by Puma to speed up its global move to cloud telephony. LoopUp will be responsible for replacing legacy systems with a fully integrated Microsoft Teams solution, paving the way for a consistent, scalable and cost-effective voice platform across Puma’s worldwide operations. Deployments have recently been delivered in Australia and New Zealand as part of a broader initiative to consolidate Puma’s voice infrastructure globally. Before working with LoopUp, Puma was managing a patchwork of local telephony providers and on-premises PBX systems across regions, resulting in inconsistent service levels and limited scalability, along with high support and renewal costs. LoopUp’s experience delivering cloud telephony for multinational enterprises will enable it to help Puma streamline and standardise its voice environment. In Australia and New Zealand, Puma had been running a traditional Cisco PBX setup with significant hardware and maintenance overhead. LoopUp’s cloud-based solution has enabled Puma to retire this infrastructure and transition users to Microsoft Teams for all calling needs, simplifying management, reducing cost and aligning with its global shift to cloud-first collaboration tools. LoopUp’s Microsoft expertise and ability to deliver in-country PSTN replacement services ensured a smooth and compliant transition tailored to Puma’s regional and global requirements. LoopUp worked closely with both Puma’s regional and global IT teams to ensure that the solution met enterprise-wide standards. The deployment maintained a global standard while enabling localised billing and compliance, enabling Puma to manage telephony consistently worldwide without compromising on cost control or operational oversight. Following successful deployments in Chile, Mexico, and Argentina, the Australia and New Zealand rollout marks the next phase in Puma’s collaboration with LoopUp. By standardising voice through LoopUp’s fully cloud-based platform, Puma is addressing challenges around fragmented infrastructure and service inconsistencies. LoopUp’s scalable solution continues to support Puma’s global communications strategy, with upcoming deployments planned across the Asia-Pacific region. “Puma wanted a consistent telephony experience across all regions without adding complexity to their global IT environment,” said Kate Godwin, VP, LoopUp. “Our solution is designed to deliver exactly that; a scalable, cloud-based Teams telephony service worldwide, with local expertise and support overlaid.” Zoran Balenovic, team head of IT Communication Systems at Puma, said, \"LoopUp has been a responsive, reliable and agile partner throughout our Teams Phone deployment journey. They’ve helped us simplify our telephony setup, reduce infrastructure costs, and deliver a consistent experience across multiple regions. Their global coverage and local support have been especially valuable as we modernise our communications platform.\""

The IT managed services and cyber security services business also aims to increase its capacity to service larger clients using the services of Challow, an IT provider specialising in legal sector compliance. Atlas will gain 16 staff, 21 customers and a London office, and The Challow brand will become “Challow, powered by Atlas Cloud”.

Atlas Clloud will absorb Challow’s customer base including firms like 7 Bedford Row and Warners Solicitors to become a provider to the legal sector, and its longstanding security-first mantra will continue to be adopted across the combined group. Pete Watson, CEO of Atlas Cloud ( pictured ) commented: “Welcoming the Challow team to Atlas Cloud is an ideal match. “Challow have spent years perfecting a unique solution, choosing to refine with their current customer base over pursuing growth. Atlas Cloud has in recent years placed a huge emphasis on developing an operational blueprint that delivers a great service in a scalable way. It’s given us greater capacity, allowed us to tighten SLAs and our customer feedback scores are now consistently world-class. Andy Fryer, Challow Director added: “Now is the right time to combine Challow’s compliance capabilities with Atlas Cloud’s security capabilities and take it to a wider market.” Sole Challow director Fryer has taken shares in the combined business and remains as Operations Director. The acquisition comes two years into a five-year strategy for Atlas Cloud. The business will continue to invest in both Newcastle and London locations, with the north becoming a hub for service and cyber security operations and the south focusing on technology operations. The next key element of the overall strategy is to ramp up its innovations team, designed to help law firms unlock the potential of Generative AI and make savings on chargeable hours."

In the first phase of this collaboration, VodafoneThree will build two masts on site to provide 5G mobile coverage for the Suffolk site and the surrounding community. VodafoneThree’s partner, Fern Communications will provide radio coverage eliminating potential communication black spots throughout the Sizewell C construction site. One of the biggest clean energy projects in Britain, Sizewell C will generate 7% of the UK’s electricity needs, providing low-carbon electricity to 6m homes for at least 60 years and saving 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere annually. The 5G coverage and radio will benefit Sizewell C’s operations enhancing communication among workers, and better mobile infrastructure will support the exchange of data and updates, improving the overall efficiency and productivity of the construction process. The deployed fibre will complement the 5G coverage and enhance operational efficiency. The connectivity project, which began in November 2024, aims to help support construction site safety, security and efficiency, and strengthen mobile connectivity across the site, as well as providing better local connectivity for residents and businesses. Damian Leydon, Sizewell C Site Delivery Director said: “Connectivity is vital for this project and a reliable connection helps us to operate at high standards of safety and efficiency, and working with VodafoneThree and Fern Communications to provide what we need on site also has the added benefit of providing 5G for the local area too.” Nick Gliddon, Business Director, VodafoneThree ( pictured ) said: “Alongside our contractors, we will deliver robust, secure, and resilient communications infrastructure that is essential to the success of one of the UK’s most significant energy projects and to support the UK’s transition to cleaner energy.”"

Mr Kane, who himself has lifelong ties to the area, expressed a keen interest in the transformative impact MCR2 will have on the region, and was keen to understand its role in driving local regeneration and supporting businesses throughout Manchester. Alongside fostering growth among its future tenants, the construction process emphasised the employment of local contractors wherever feasible. This strategy aimed to strengthen the local economy while reflecting the project’s dedication to minimising environmental impact. Mike Kane MP commented: “It’s remarkable to see a project of this scale right at the heart of the community in Wythenshawe. This facility sets a new benchmark for sustainable, cutting-edge infrastructure while creating pathways to economic growth and wider opportunities for the region”. During a tour of the facility, Mr Kane was shown how MCR2 exemplifies environmentally sustainable design. As part of the construction process, Datum conducted a voluntary carbon impact assessment and integrated numerous sustainability measures, including the installation of highly efficient free cooling systems to minimise environmental impact and the incorporation of heat exchange technology to support local community heating initiatives. The site’s backup generators run on environmentally friendly Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) instead of red diesel. With a design PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of just 1.25, MCR2 sets a leading standard in energy efficiency. Its data halls are built to accommodate a wide range of clients – from SMEs to large enterprises – offering flexible power density options and robust IT infrastructure support. The ultra-secure site includes advanced security measures, including police-linked on-site facilities, ensuring optimal data protection and connectivity. Matt Edgley, COO at Datum Datacentres, emphasised the project’s broader impact: “We were delighted to welcome Mike Kane MP to MCR2 and showcase the culmination of this significant construction effort. The facility symbolises our commitment to revitalising Wythenshawe while bolstering Manchester’s growth as one of the UK’s premier tech hubs.” MCR2 is poised to play a pivotal role in driving regional economic growth and attracting enterprise activity to Manchester. Its successful completion not only represents a significant achievement in sustainable development but also opens new opportunities for businesses across diverse industries. Jon Healy, Managing Director EMEA at Salute, commented: “It has been a fantastic project to be involved in, and it’s great to see the positive impact it will have on the region. This state-of-the-art and sustainable data centre provides the critical infrastructure needed to support the region’s continued growth.” The official launch of MCR2 took place at the end of June and the site is now welcoming visitors who would like to tour the facility.

        "cleaned_text": "Fast-growing tech firm Alton Valley has added two major industry accolades to its growing list of honours, cementing its position as one of the UK’s rising stars in IT infrastructure, managed IT services and bespoke security solutions. The Pride Park-based company has won the Managed Services Provider (MSP) of the Year (Up to £10m turnover) at the Technology Reseller Awards 2025, a prestigious event that recognises excellence and innovation across the UK’s IT sector. In addition to the company’s success, Managing Partner Carl Hamill narrowly missed out in winning Industry Leader of the Year, a category reserved for those making a significant impact across the technology landscape. The double recognition comes just weeks after Alton Valley won Best IT Service at the 2025 Small Business Awards, further establishing its status as a trusted and fast-growing force in the UK’s tech industry. These awards follow a period of exceptional performance for Alton Valley. Earlier this year, the firm announced record-breaking financial results, reporting a £7 million turnover and quadrupling its revenue over the past three years. The company attributes its continued success to its strategic client partnerships, the expansion of its service portfolio, and an unwavering focus on innovation—particularly in the fields of managed IT, advanced infrastructure solutions and cybersecurity. “This is a fantastic way to celebrate what’s already been an incredible year for our team and our clients,” said Carl Hamill. “Winning MSP of the Year and being named runner-up for Industry Leader is recognition of the passion, skill and dedication that defines everything we do. We’re proud of how far we’ve come – but even more excited about what’s next.” The Technology Reseller Awards, held at the Hilton, in London, bring together top-performing businesses from across the UK’s IT and channel sectors. Alton Valley stood out to the judges for its client-first service model, strong technical expertise and consistent delivery of results in an increasingly competitive market. Judges praised the firm for its scalable approach to managed services, its proactive stance on security and its investment in developing long-term client relationships. The company’s rapid ascent, underpinned by a clear growth strategy and an agile team culture, positioned it as a standout among businesses with turnover up to £10 million. In particular, the panel commended Carl Hamill’s leadership in driving innovation, building a strong internal culture and championing the development of high-quality, sustainable IT services. Being recognised in the Industry Leader of the Year category reflects his growing influence and credibility across the national tech sector. Founded with a vision to make high-grade technology accessible to businesses of all sizes, Alton Valley has become a trusted partner for clients across a range of industries. Its service offerings include fully managed IT support, security infrastructure, cybersecurity, application development and strategic IT consultancy. “These awards are a reflection of our entire team,” added Carl. “From our engineers to our support staff, everyone at Alton Valley shares a commitment to delivering real value for our clients. “We’re building something special here and this recognition helps validate that we’re on the right path.” As Alton Valley continues to scale, its focus remains firmly on delivering cutting-edge technology solutions with integrity, expertise, and a genuine commitment to customer success.

        "title": "Boom Launches ARC: ‘Game-Changing’ Dual-Host Bridge For Video Conferencing",
        "cleaned_text": "Manufacturer Boom Collaboration has launched a dual host connectivity hub, set to revolutionise how video conferencing meetings are staged in the future. The Boom ARC smart bridge for intuitive host switching, is being hailed as the dawning of a new era, by joining in-room and Bring Your Own Meeting (BYOM) systems together for the first time, in a best of both worlds scenario. “The video conferencing world moves fast, and we know we have to move even faster to stay ahead,” says Co-Founder Fredrik Hörnkvist. Hybrid reality “Our focus has always been on creating solutions that simplify collaboration while delivering an exceptional experience, based on any device across any platform in any room. We believe the ARC is unique in the market – designed for the hybrid reality we all work in. It offers automatic switching between room-based and personal devices, while providing USB-C power delivery and versatile input/output options – including HDMI, for effortless flexibility. It’s set to become a new star for us.” He highlighted: “Since the pandemic a lot of organisations have learned that whether it was hybrid work or bringing everyone back into the office, whatever model they chose, many went all in on dedicated in-room solutions – Teams, Zoom or Google Meet etc. This was great and at the forefront of market developments at the time. “Now many larger organisations are realising, after analysing user behaviour, that employees overwhelmingly prefer the simplicity of a single-cable setup using their own device. “The ARC solves this dilemma in a magical way so they don’t have to sacrifice the investments already made but can have their cake and eat it by combining both options within the same ecosystem.” Texas-based Boom offers the complete array of conferencing solutions, from dedicated kits to videobars, multi-camera controllers, in-room systems and cutting edge connectivity. It can be sourced from UK distributor Aldous Systems. Fellow founder, Holli Hulett emphasised: “There’s already been so much interest and excitement. The ARC reflects our continuing mission to simplify conferencing and create intuitive tools for modern work. “Simplicity is our North Star guiding light – but what sets the ARC apart is how effortlessly it blends flexibility and platform-agnostic performance with a zero learning curve.” Key ARC Features: She concluded: “The ARC is a perfect addition and represents the next chapter following the launch of our ZYGO one-cable-connection hub last year. The ARC can be tailored to perform exactly how customers want. That could be Teams on one screen and Meet on another – any combination in any format is possible. It unites everything in a best of both worlds way. “In addition, the ARC ensures less maintenance and support for in-room systems whilst also delivering all the AI and smarter features that today’s latest end points deliver, from one intuitive piece of hardware. It’s our new box of tricks that turns traditional conferencing on its head!” To learn more visit boom.co Please follow and like us: Please follow and like us: Author Neil Trim Publishing Director of Kingswood Media Ltd View all posts Neil Trim Publishing Director of Kingswood Media Ltd View all posts Neil Trim Publishing Director of Kingswood Media Ltd View all posts Neil Trim Publishing Director of Kingswood Media Ltd Views: 202"

        "cleaned_text": "Kyndryl taps into its decades of infrastructure-level expertise to deploy an enterprise-grade Framework with intelligent AI agents that learn, adapt and evolve to turn insights into action The Kyndryl Agentic AI Framework self-organises, scales, and securely executes tasks across diverse IT estates and complex workflows to increase efficiency and innovation for impact Kyndryl , a leading provider of mission-critical enterprise technology services, today launched the Kyndryl Agentic AI Framework, a new approach to deploying agentic AI to augment human teams. The enterprise-grade Framework orchestrates and dispatches a portfolio of specialised, self-directed, self-learning AI agents that dynamically respond to shifting conditions and keep humans in the loop for oversight. The Kyndryl Agentic AI Framework enables enterprises to adopt, deploy and scale agentic AI-powered solutions – whether on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid IT setting – to transform and improve their business operations. In deploying the Framework, Kyndryl leverages its expertise from thousands of infrastructure deployments and its experience with generating over 12 million AI-driven insights monthly via Kyndryl Bridge. The Framework combines advanced algorithms, self-learning, optimisation and secure-by-design AI agents that translate complex data into clear, understandable insights. “As customers worldwide adopt agentic AI to gain a competitive edge, it will increasingly impact the entire technology stack, including applications and business workflows. Kyndryl is uniquely positioned to provide a holistic, infrastructure-first perspective that enables customers to deploy AI with confidence across mission-critical systems with scalability and industry standard security,” said Ismail Amla, Senior Vice President, Kyndryl Consult. “With our unique insights from Kyndryl Bridge, our differentiated Agentic AI Framework, and our experience managing some of the world’s largest technology estates, we can help companies design, implement, and run agentic AI solutions at scale—tailored to their specific business productivity and innovation goals.” Customers across industries are already working with Kyndryl to explore and understand how they can leverage the Agentic Framework’s sophisticated capabilities, including: This new Framework comes at a critical moment for enterprise leaders who are struggling to see benefits from AI use cases. In fact, according to Kyndryl’s recently-published 2025 People Readiness Report , only 4 in 10 leaders report using AI-powered insights to enhance decision-making or unlock business growth. In addition, only one-fifth of business leaders say the primary use case of AI in their organisation is to develop new products and services for customers. The Kyndryl Agentic AI Framework can help organisations confidently deploy AI with trust and security in mind. The Framework was built with industry-standard encryption protocols, privacy-by-design principles and zero-trust security – fostering trust in AI-driven processes and assurances that agent actions are traceable, interpretable and continuously improved with human oversight. It can also be tailored to meet enterprises’ needs and adapt to industries through self-directed learning, enabling organisations to apply the Framework to a wide range of use cases and projects with speed and confidence. Kyndryl Consult experts will work side-by-side with customers to assess, design, engineer and plan deployments of the Framework that are tailored to individual customer business requirements.

        "title": "93% of UK Organisations Now Use AI, But Only 7% Have Fully Embedded Governance, Trustmarque Research Finds",
        "cleaned_text": "AI adoption has become nearly universal among UK enterprises, with 93% of UK organisations using the technology in some form. However, only 7% have fully embedded governance frameworks to manage its risks, according to Trustmarque’s AI Governance Index 2025. AI governance is the framework of policies and controls to ensure AI operates transparently, fairly, and meets regulatory requirements. As AI becomes embedded in critical business processes, governance must be integrated from design through to deployment. By preventing bias, safeguarding data and meeting compliance requirements, solid governance builds confidence and paves the way for long‑term, trustworthy AI. Trustmarque (a highly accredited technology reseller) has launched a report, based on a survey of 507 senior UK IT decision-makers, highlighting a widening gap between the speed of AI adoption and the maturity of supporting governance structures. Key findings include: The research found that organisations still largely rely on legacy software development processes which haven’t been updated to account for AI-specific risks such as model bias or explainability gaps. Only 28% apply bias detection during testing, and fewer still (22%) test for model interpretability. Infrastructure and tooling also present barriers to governance according to the IT leaders surveyed. Just 4% of organisations say their data and infrastructure environments are fully prepared to support AI at scale. Registries, audit trails, and version control for AI models are often manual or missing entirely. When it comes to accountability for AI oversight, the research found it is fragmented. Only 9% report alignment between IT leadership and governance, while 19% say there is no clear owner for governance activity. Executive engagement remains low, with most AI governance driven at the departmental level rather than through strategic leadership. This lack of central ownership is reflected in how few organisations measure the effectiveness of their governance. Just 18% have implemented continuous monitoring with KPIs to track progress. “Our report shows that AI adoption is outpacing governance,” said Seb Burrell, Head of AI at Trustmarque. “It’s a clear gap – 93% of organisations are using AI but only 7% have fully embedded governance frameworks. “Right now, systems and processes haven’t kept up with the speed of innovation. Development teams lack proper tooling and infrastructure, and the issues are compounded by the lack of management buy-in for building robust governance systems. “Governance is also often seen as a constraint, but our findings suggest otherwise. Organisations that have adopted AI governance are seeing real, tangible benefits – faster deployments, stronger accountability, and reduced manual review cycles. It’s a vital support function to enable responsible, scalable AI.” “What stood out in this research is how many organisations are adopting AI without fully understanding the risks,” said James McKeown, AI Specialist and Principal Test Consultant at TrustMarque. “We see projects moving fast, but often without the checks, controls, or delivery oversight needed to support them. That’s where governance makes the difference. Without it, you’re not just risking compliance gaps, you’re risking poor outcomes, rising costs, and wasted time. Governance isn’t about slowing things down. It’s what helps organisations scale AI safely and effectively.” To view the report, please visit here .

        "cleaned_text": "· London businesses can now consolidate connectivity, managed services, and cybersecurity, backed by the fastest fibre network built exclusively for businesses · Completed acquisitions of 40fi (cybersecurity) and Optimity (managed services), and strategic investment in Layer8 (network management for commercial real estate) · 80+ new specialists join Vorboss, expanding total workforce to nearly 400 Vorboss, London’s leading fibre network built exclusively for business, today announced the expansion of its managed services portfolio, reinforcing its position as the trusted single provider for the city’s enterprise connectivity needs. This strategic move reflects the growing demand for comprehensive, resilient services from a single, expert partner – particularly in light of the increasing complexity of cybersecurity threats and IT infrastructure. As part of this strategy, Vorboss has closed three acquisitions designed to broaden its capabilities beyond its core strength in managed network infrastructure. Among these are 40fi, a respected cybersecurity business, and Optimity, a leading provider of managed IT services. Together, these acquisitions bring an additional 80 experienced professionals into the Vorboss team, significantly enhancing the company’s ability to deliver end-to-end solutions for London’s most demanding businesses. Vorboss is excited to welcome the hundreds of customers that Optimity and 40fi serve across the UK today, and look forward to continuing the high levels of customer service and technical expertise currently provided. This expansion addresses a clear and urgent need from Vorboss customers: the ability to consolidate connectivity, IT, and security under one accountable provider. By integrating cybersecurity expertise and managed IT services capabilities into its offering, Vorboss is now uniquely positioned to provide a comprehensive suite of services — spanning secure network infrastructure, endpoint management, threat mitigation, and strategic IT and cybersecurity consultancy. Tim Creswick, CEO of Vorboss: “Vorboss has a long history in managed services, but for the last 6 years, our focus has been on delivering the best enterprise fibre network London has ever seen. That has been a huge project, commanding millions of hours of labour from our team, and we are now connecting thousands of business customers to that network – all at 10Gbps and above. I’m excited that we’re now able to return to some of our managed services roots, with the timely addition of cybersecurity services. These are things that our customers and partners ask us about all the time. As operators of extensive, high-capacity infrastructure, we have a huge amount of real expertise in-house already, so customers know that they’re getting advice from real practitioners, not just consultants. The addition of the Optimity and 40fi teams gives us some immediate scale to address those customer needs, with the same vertically integrated, high quality approach that they’ve come to love from us”. In addition, Vorboss has also invested in Layer8, a first-of-a-kind software platform enabling building operators to automate, manage, and monetise their networks. Designed for commercial real estate environments, Layer8 gives building managers, managed service providers (MSPs), and non-technical users simple, secure control over on-site network infrastructure. “Layer8 is a fantastic business – a great example of UK entrepreneurship in a co-founder led, innovative software company that has already proven a path to revenue. I’m excited that the culture at Vorboss, and our highly technical, software-first approach has meant that we can be a great home for the business through the next stage of growth. Layer8 provides a market-leading platform to landlords and building operators, so the opportunities for both businesses will be huge. It’s also something that our partners will love too.” ” Customers will now have the option to purchase a complete suite of managed IT, cybersecurity, and connectivity services from Vorboss – either bundled together or individually, to suit their requirements. Vorboss will also extend these new capabilities to their channel partners, enabling them to expand their own offerings. As always, Vorboss remains committed to a neutral approach -empowering the channel rather than competing with it. “A lot of our channel partners struggle with the scale to provide some of these services, especially in a market where it’s increasingly difficult to attract cybersecurity talent. We’re able to support those needs with our now 400-strong team, and Central London HQ. We know that many of our partners have deep, trusted relationships with their customers – our approach has always been to serve the customer the way they prefer – and for many that is by working with a trusted partner”. These acquisitions solidify Vorboss as London’s leading technology partner for business. The unique, high capacity network, and associated capabilities underpins a strong position in a market where customers are growing tired of legacy providers, and legacy infrastructure. to learn more visit: vorboss.com Please follow and like us: Please follow and like us: Author Neil Trim Publishing Director of Kingswood Media Ltd View all posts Neil Trim Publishing Director of Kingswood Media Ltd View all posts Neil Trim Publishing Director of Kingswood Media Ltd View all posts Neil Trim Publishing Director of Kingswood Media Ltd Views: 363"

        "title": "Why Auto Dealerships Are Turning to Intermedia to Jump-Start Their Communications",
        "cleaned_text": "Intermedia's unified UC and CC platform combines voice, messaging, analytics, and more into one fully integrated system Auto dealerships run on conversations, not spreadsheets. From finance managers closing deals to service advisors coordinating with techs, instant, crystal-clear communication across locations and departments is mission-critical, not a luxury. Yet many dealership groups still rely on legacy systems; clunky phones, unreliable internet, and siloed tools that make even basic coordination feel impossible. That doesn’t cut it in a world where customers expect rapid follow-up, consistent service and exactly zero dropped calls. That’s where Intermedia comes in; with a unified communications (UC) and contact center (CC) platform that combines voice, messaging, analytics, and more into one fully integrated system. Rainey Used Cars and VENSEARCH: A Strategic Partnership for Change Rainey Used Cars, the largest independent used car dealership in Georgia, was living that exact pain. With 10 locations, 300 staff, and thousands of transactions a year, their outdated communications setup wasn’t just inconvenient but costly. Outages were expensive and managing disconnected systems drained productivity. That’s when they turned to trusted IT partner VENSEARCH , who brought Intermedia into the picture. Together, they replaced Rainey’s patchwork of tools with a unified communications and contact center platform that was purpose-built for modern dealership needs. Intermedia’s All-in-One UC and CC Platform – Deployed Fast and Flawlessly Rainey needed more than just new phones. They needed reliability, mobility, visibility, and a seamless deployment. Intermedia delivered. Call quality became crystal clear. Numbers ported in hours. Not a single call was dropped. “Leading up to the implementation, I lost countless nights of sleep worrying about how a system-wide switch would impact our business,” said General Manager Tommy McDonald. “But when the transition happened, it was unbelievably smooth. We couldn’t believe how easy Intermedia’s system was to use.” UC and CC in One Platform – No Silos, No Gaps Facing limitations with their previous system, Rainey needed a more unified, dealership-friendly solution. With help from VENSEARCH, they chose Intermedia’s tightly integrated platform, delivering UC, CC, and analytics in one place. The platform supports unique dealership workflows, from service bays and showrooms to back offices, through built-in call routing, hunt groups, IVRs, call queues, recording and 14 auto-attendants. Whether it’s a customer calling about a repair or a finance manager following up on paperwork, the right person is reached quickly, without chaos or overlap. Everything’s accessible via mobile, desktop, or desk phone, keeping teams connected no matter where they are. Real-Time Visibility Without the Spreadsheet Chase Before Intermedia, Rainey’s managers had limited insight into call handling. With built-in analytics, that changed immediately. Live dashboards now show metrics like call volumes, wait times, and department-level performance in real time. Managers can spot trends, troubleshoot bottlenecks, and coach teams using actual data, not a gut feeling. It’s insight that raises accountability and improves the customer experience across the board. Recording and reviewing calls adds another layer of quality control, especially critical in departments like finance and service, where precision and professionalism matter most. Intermedia’s Microsoft Teams Integration – Built for Dealerships Already in the Microsoft Ecosystem For dealerships already operating within a Microsoft Teams environment, or considering one, Intermedia offers an industry-first integration that brings its full UC, CC, and analytics suite natively into Teams. That means users can handle calls, messages, voicemails, and more, all without leaving the Teams interface. Everything dealerships rely on from Intermedia’s platform, from advanced call handling and analytics to archiving and contact center tools, is now accessible inside the workspace their teams already use every day. No need for extra Teams Phone licenses. No bolt-on apps. No switching between systems. Just a single, streamlined experience that simplifies adoption and centralizes management. Want to dive deeper? Built to Scale, Delivered Through Partners Who Get It Rainey’s rollout wasn’t just fast; it was virtually flawless. That’s because Intermedia’s partner-led model puts experts like VENSEARCH in charge of the full lifecycle. From planning and testing to launch and support, the transition happened in just three days, with zero downtime. That kind of delivery only works when your partner knows your business. Intermedia’s partner-first model empowers resellers to brand, package, and bill the solution their way, while customers get a platform that works out of the box. With features like long-term archiving, compliance tools, and built-in scalability, dealerships can meet today’s needs while staying ready for what’s next. The Comms Stack Dealerships Didn’t Know They Needed In a high-volume, customer-first industry, communication should be a competitive advantage, not a vulnerability. Intermedia’s UC, CC and analytics platform gives dealerships the unified tools, visibility, and performance they need to deliver great service and scale with confidence. For Rainey Used Cars, that meant finally replacing unreliable systems with a solution that just works. For other dealerships, it’s a chance to stop patching problems and start building a smarter way to connect. Are your dealership clients still relying on unreliable phones, siloed systems, or costly bolt-ons? It might be time for a smarter approach.

        "title": "What’s Keeping IT Directors Up at Night? The Hidden Psychology of AI Adoption",
        "cleaned_text": "How IT Leaders are moving from AI anxiety to competitive advantage through integrated workplace intelligence It’s 3:17 AM, and across the globe, IT Directors are wide awake, scrolling through compliance reports, flagging AI-assisted decisions that lack proper documentation. The haunting question: “What happens when auditors ask us to explain how our AI made a recommendation that affected high-stakes decisions?” These technology leaders aren’t alone. Across industries, IT Directors face sleepless nights filled with AI-related concerns—not excitement-driven wakeful hours, but anxiety-driven questions with no easy answers. The Integration Nightmare The promise of AI was simplification, but reality has become increasingly complex. Organizations now manage multiple AI tools—ChatGPT for content creation, Claude for document analysis, Microsoft Copilot for Office integration, Jasper for marketing—while collaboration sprawls across different messaging platforms and video conferencing systems. Furthermore, many of these tools aren’t configurable to businesses’ individual needs. Organizations need tools that are adaptable and tailored to their functional requirements. IT leaders express frustration over AI tool fragmentation and lack of flexibility: “We’ve accidentally created tool silos. Each department picked its favorite solutions. Now we have dozens of platforms that don’t talk to each other. Teams spend more time managing integrations than benefiting from these capabilities.” Context gets lost as information moves between systems, decisions become fragmented, and intelligent automation turns into an administrative burden. The Trust Deficit Beyond integration lies a deeper concern: the black box problem. AI systems can make recommendations affecting everything from hiring to customer service, but many lack the transparency required for business accountability. “I need to explain why our AI suggested prioritizing one support ticket over another. When the AI says ‘trust me’ but won’t show its work, I’m left holding the bag when things go wrong,” notes one IT Director. This “AI trust deficit” creates bottlenecked workflows in which AI acceleration is neutralized by human hesitation. Regulated industries face particular challenges when AI decisions affect financial, healthcare, or employment outcomes. The Human Factor Perhaps the most complex challenge isn’t technical—it’s human. Implementing AI means navigating employee fears and resistance to change, and balancing automation with human value. “My biggest challenge isn’t configuring the AI—it’s helping experienced employees understand that AI won’t replace them, but will change how they work. Some days I feel more like a therapist than a technologist.” Traditional change management approaches often fail with AI implementation. Unlike predictable software, AI systems evolve and learn, creating moving targets for training programs. The Solution: Contextual Intelligence Though the challenges are complex, the solution doesn’t have to be. AI-first tools, such as Zoom AI Companion, help address these challenges through “contextual intelligence”—AI that understands individual requests within a broader business context. “At Zoom, we’re seeing a fundamental shift in how IT departments operate with AI at their core,” said Dharmesh Panchmatia, head of IT Enterprise Applications & Shared Services at Zoom. “The intelligence-first approach means moving from reactive troubleshooting to proactive system optimization through AI and machine learning capabilities.” Zoom tackles integration nightmares by consolidating AI capabilities within a single collaboration environment through Zoom AI Companion and integrations with supported third-party apps, bringing the most important information onto a single pane of glass. AI-generated meeting summaries automatically generate tasks for participants and inform project documents, chat conversations provide context for AI suggestions, and document collaboration feeds into meeting preparation and follow-up, all within Zoom Workplace. For transparency, Zoom AI Companion is designed to provide grounded responses and citations that help show its reasoning. When suggesting meeting agendas, it cites its sources and explains which previous meetings, documents, and conversations informed recommendations. This explainability helps build necessary trust. Additionally, Zoom does not use any customer audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments, or other communications like customer content (such as poll results, whiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom’s or its third-party artificial intelligence models. Cultural change gets addressed when intelligence emerges naturally within familiar workflows rather than requiring dramatic behavioral changes. Team members don’t learn new interfaces; AI capabilities appear as helpful enhancements to existing collaboration patterns. From Anxiety to Advantage The transformation requires recognizing that workplace intelligence isn’t about replacing human decision-making—it’s about enhancing human collaboration with contextual, transparent, and integrated AI capabilities. “IT leaders need to completely rethink their team structure,” noted Panchmatia. “Organizations need to prioritize AI literacy across all IT functions while building robust data platforms that can support both traditional analytics and advanced AI models. It’s about creating an environment where AI augments human decision-making rather than replacing it.” As one healthcare IT Director reflects: “Six months ago, I was losing sleep over AI compliance risks. Now I sleep better knowing our AI decisions are explainable, our teams are adapting gradually, and our intelligence platform grows smarter as our collaboration deepens.” Organizations succeeding with AI aren’t those with the most advanced algorithms or the biggest budgets. They’re the ones recognizing workplace intelligence as a collaboration challenge, not just technology implementation. “The key to success in this transformation is maintaining a strong focus on ethical AI implementation while ensuring these initiatives deliver real business value,” said Panchmatia. “It’s not about implementing AI for AI’s sake—it’s about solving concrete problems and improving operational efficiency.” The 3 AM wake-up calls are becoming less frequent. IT Directors are sleeping better, knowing their AI implementations are built on solid foundations of transparency, integration, and human-centered design. The age of intelligence has arrived—and it looks more collaborative than anyone expected.

        "title": "Avaya Infinity to Support Anthropic’s MCP: What New Capabilities Does It Bring?",
        "cleaned_text": "Avaya Infinity platform will support Anthropic's MCP in a move that can see orchestration across a users multiple AI systems Avaya has announced that its Infinity platform will support Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Q4 2025. “The largest and most complex organizations must be able to leverage new tools, models, and technologies as the world realizes the full potential of AI in real time,” Patrick Dennis, CEO, Avaya, said. “That’s why we decided to accelerate what was an MCP moonshot, an innovation-first initiative, into our Infinity platform 2025 roadmap.” With this announcement, Avaya aims to give customers more choice and flexibility in connecting AI and data across their entire workflows within the Infinity platform. MCP’s Role in Enterprise Communications Model Context Protocol, developed by Anthropic, is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. This helps AI models securely interact with external tools, data sources, and APIs while maintaining context throughout interactions. For Avaya Infinity, this means the platform can now orchestrate workflows that adapt in real time rather than following predetermined decision trees. Traditional contact center and UC platforms operate on static routing rules and predefined workflows. When a customer calls, the system follows branching logic based on limited data points—time of day, caller ID, and previous interaction history stored in the CRM. MCP changes this paradigm by allowing large language models to access and synthesize information from multiple sources simultaneously. “Customers need AI that understands who it’s speaking to, what matters now, and how to align every response to their unique business logic and customer expectations. Through Avaya, that’s what MCP makes possible,” David Funck, Chief Technology Officer, Avaya, said. The technical implementation involves connecting the Infinity platform to diverse data repositories—CRMs, knowledge bases, electronic health records, financial systems—and allowing AI models to query and correlate information across these sources in near real time. This enables Infinity users to provide their customers with what Avaya describes as “hyper-personalized experiences,” as all their points of interaction across various systems can be brought into the platform. The Databricks partnership adds crucial enterprise-grade data governance capabilities. This collaboration addresses a key enterprise concern: how to deploy AI tools that access sensitive customer data while maintaining compliance, audit trails, and fine-grained access controls. This acknowledges a major concern for enterprises breaking down silos: keeping track of data at all times. From Static Workflows to Dynamic Customer Orchestration The MCP integration stands to unlock several transformative use cases. Consider a healthcare scenario where a patient calls about a billing inquiry while simultaneously having an active treatment plan. With MCP, the AI can instantly access the patient’s EHR, insurance information, billing history, and current treatment protocols located on another platform to provide contextual responses that address not just the immediate billing question but also proactively surface relevant information about upcoming appointments or treatment requirements. In financial services, this translates to AI systems that can correlate market conditions, customer portfolio performance, regulatory changes, and personal financial goals during a single interaction. Rather than transferring customers between departments or requiring multiple authentication steps, the AI maintains context across all relevant data sources while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. The technology enables what Avaya terms “contextual experiences that create enduring connections.” This goes beyond traditional personalization—which typically involves inserting a customer’s name or referencing previous purchases—toward true contextual intelligence that understands customer intent, historical patterns, and business logic simultaneously. For enterprises managing complex customer journeys across multiple touchpoints, MCP support means AI agents can maintain context as customers move between voice calls, chat sessions, email interactions, and self-service portals. The system remembers not just what was discussed but also the emotional context, business constraints, and outcome preferences that shaped those interactions. Positioning for the Enterprise AI Era Avaya’s MCP adoption represents a strategic bet on open AI architectures over proprietary solutions. By supporting MCP, Avaya enables customers to choose AI models from hyperscale cloud providers or emerging innovators without redesigning their communication workflows. This open approach addresses a growing enterprise concern about vendor lock-in, forcing them to shop around for interoperability rather than best-in-breed solutions. Organizations that invest heavily in AI-powered communication platforms want assurance they can adapt as AI technology evolves. Avaya’s commitment to model-agnostic integration provides this flexibility, while its partnership with Databricks helps maintain centralized governance and security controls. As enterprises move beyond pilot AI projects toward production deployments, they’re demanding platforms that can scale across complex organizational structures while maintaining compliance and control. Looking ahead, this strategy positions Avaya to capture value as enterprises transition from department-specific AI tools toward integrated AI platforms spanning customer service, sales, marketing, and operational functions."

        "title": "Gamma Edge: The Growth Engine Channel Partners Asked For — And Helped Build",
        "cleaned_text": "Gamma Edge is the new strategic partner framework built with, not just for, UK channel partners, bringing data, incentives, and full-stack flexibility together under one smart framework Channel partners across the UK and Europe are navigating a trickier landscape than ever. New logos are harder to land, legacy estates are expensive to maintain, and customers are demanding more from less. The tech stack is shifting fast, and between AI, voice security, the demands of compliance, and changing buying behaviours, the pressure’s building. But herein lies the crux: growth feels harder, even for experienced, ambitious partners. “A lot of it comes down to listening,” said Will Morey, Managing Director of Channel at Gamma . “I really believe that successful channel strategy starts with understanding, truly listening to what partners are experiencing in the market.” It’s that principle that shaped Gamma Edge , a new channel growth framework designed not in a boardroom but out of dozens of honest, detailed partner conversations. The goal is to give partners a sharper edge in a market that’s only getting tougher and to back them with real tools, insight, and support that tangibly move the needle. What Is Gamma Edge — And Why Now? Gamma Edge is far more than a straightforward refresh or a promotion cycle. It’s a full-on re-evaluation of what a channel partnership should represent in 2025. It’s strategic, structured, and personal. It’s handcrafted around partner ambitions, not product quotas. It’s also tailored to meet partners where they are, whether scaling into new markets, preparing for investment, or consolidating toward a leaner, more profitable model. “After listening to our partners, we knew we needed to give them a real edge in the market — hence the name,” Morey stressed. “They’re up against economic challenges, strong competition, and a fast-changing tech landscape. So we asked: What can Gamma do to give our partners a tangible advantage? ” The result is a new five-pillar framework that integrates data planning, commercial reward, product flexibility, and technical support into a single, joined-up system. This framework is backed by Gamma’s long-term investment and relationship-first mindset. Critically, it doesn’t start with a pitch but a question. “Rather than leading with products, we begin every conversation with: Where is your business now? Where do you want to be? And how can we help you get there? Every partner’s journey is unique, and our goal is to play a meaningful role in that journey.” The Five Pillars of Gamma Edge: Built to Remove Friction and Add Value The first piece of the puzzle is Partner Pulse , a co-planning approach that leverages real performance data to set goals and stay aligned. “Data plays a huge part in this,” said Morey. “Gamma’s leadership in SIP, UCaaS, mobile, and cybersecurity gives us access to deep insights that we share with partners; everything from vertical performance to churn benchmarks.” The second is Velocity , a cleaner, more generous rebate model that’s refreshingly straightforward. The more you grow across the portfolio, the more Gamma reinvests in your business. “They could earn back 25p, 30p, even 40p per pound spent, all designed to support their ongoing growth.” Elements is the third pillar: Gamma’s full technology stack, made modular. “We don’t believe in offering one-size-fits-all tools,” Morey outlined. “Partners can mix and match UCaaS, cybersecurity, mobile, IoT, and more, choosing what’s right for each customer scenario.” Boost is next, signalling commercial firepower designed to make UCaaS simpler to sell and more profitable to run. “The first major Boost is fully inclusive UCaaS minutes,” Morey added. “Whether it’s local or international, all call minutes are included. That simplifies billing, removes hidden complexities, and lets partners treat UCaaS like any SaaS product; easy to sell, manage, and scale.” Gamma is also offering aggressive connectivity pricing when bundled with UCaaS, in many cases below BT Openreach rates, letting partners lead with stronger propositions and better margins. Finally, there’s Migrate , a practical framework to move customers off legacy estates and into future-ready platforms without pulling partners away from the day-to-day. “Migrate helps identify migration priorities with compliance and security checks, offers commercial incentives, and even allows partners to outsource the process to Gamma,” Morey explained. “That way, they can keep focusing on growth while we handle the heavy lifting.” This Is What a Relationship-First Channel Programme Looks Like More than anything, Gamma Edge reflects a more profound shift in Gamma’s perception of its market role. Gamma represents a long-term collaborator who is invested in building value and delivering confidence. “Partners are increasingly looking for long-term relationships with providers who are compliant, secure, financially stable, and capable of sustained investment,” Morey emphasised. “The Telecom Security Act, for example, is prompting serious questions about readiness and resilience.” The subtext of Gamma Edge is one of resilience, trust, and investment. Partners are looking for signs of stability, signs that their provider will still be here in five years’ time and evolving with them. “It comes down to two things: completeness of vision and ability to execute ,” asserted Morey. “That’s where Gamma really shines. We’ve got the scale, experience, and commitment to help you deliver results.” A Partnership in Progress: Real Conversations, Real Action But for Gamma, this is only the beginning. The business continues to hold open, honest conversations with partners to challenge assumptions and drive meaningful progress. These discussions are shaping a new insights-led report to be released at this year’s Gammaverse on October 2 nd in London — a candid and practical reflection of what partners are experiencing, and what needs to change across the channel. Rather than a box-ticking exercise, it’s about listening with purpose and acting on what matters. Taking real insight and using it to make decisions that help partners grow faster and go further. Ready to Get an Edge? Gamma Edge is already live. From this month, Gamma is rolling out tailored partner plans and onboarding new participants across the UK.

        "title": "Preventing Digital Meltdowns: The Critical Role of Contact Center Stress Testing",
        "cleaned_text": "Contact centers are the frontline for many businesses' interactions with customers. Serving businesses in industries ranging from healthcare and financial services to tech companies, they are a vital part of many companies’ operations. As such, many organizations put emphasis on trying to optimize customer experience in their contact centers. Reducing wait times, training staff in product knowledge, and optimizing post-call summaries for ongoing improvements are all tactics deployed to do this. However, all of these strategies and plans to keep the customer happy are contingent on one thing: is your contact center operational? If a customer tries to call in but bottlenecks are throttling your contact center or it is at capacity, then no amount of staff training can help you. Such a scenario may equally destroy any previous goodwill you had with a client, as a Zendesk 2025 finding found more than one-half of consumers may switch to a competitor after only one bad experience. “Without regular, comprehensive stress tests, organizations risk unnecessary outages, degraded call quality, and lost business during these critical times,” Sam Melvin, Co-Founder of Voxology explained. Stress testing your contact center should be as much a part of an organization’s customer service strategy as anything else. If your contact center is the heartbeat of your customer experience, are you sure that it won’t skip a beat when it matters most? Why Stress Testing Is Vital Stress tests evaluate whether contact center infrastructure can handle anticipated load while maintaining acceptable quality standards. Contact center setups rely on an ecosystem of vendors that provide the various components needed for a contact center setup. Although your current setup may be optimized and functionally operational, Melvin points out how “things change.” “Your carrier and software providers make changes that you may or may not be privy to. Or you may have made some tweaks to your call flows or your data dip. We’ve seen issues pop up in lots of places,” he said. Whether it is your network provider, your cloud host, carrier, or even the contact center itself, changes made in any layer may create a ripple effect in your otherwise functioning setup. “Unless you’re the actual carrier connecting two of your own subscribers, like AT&T or BT, you’re relying on at least one other vendor, if not multiple. Therefore, you are subject to any issues or updates they make on their side,” Melvin said. Because you cannot keep track of all these individual changes, nor how they might interact, stress testing is the only way to ensure your contact center continues to stay operational. Equally, the problem created in the above example may not become obvious until placed under peak pressure. “In a lot of industries, there are peak seasons, like in healthcare it may be during flu season, with insurance, it’s during those renewal times of the year,” Melvin explained. Peak seasons can push communication systems to their capacity. But in a system that hasn’t been stress tested, this won’t just be a case of longer wait times for customers; it could mean dropped calls, poor audio quality, and even a scenario where some customers cannot connect. Unlike routine monitoring that confirms systems are operational, stress testing deliberately pushes systems to their breaking point to identify vulnerabilities before they impact real customers. “Stress testing is all about capacity testing and making sure your team and your own infrastructure can handle the volumes you expect,” Melvin said. The Business Case for Regular Stress Testing Although a single stress test is a step in the right direction, equally important is the frequency with which you run them. While some organizations view stress testing as a one-time project after a major update to their telecom stack, it can only truly be effective as a strategy when implemented as a regular practice. “Stress testing regularly helps teams build courage and give them assurance they’ve got a stopgap.” Without this validation process, teams must rely on hope, which, as Google’s Site Reliability Engineering team famously observed, “is not a strategy.” Equally, stress testing provides essential protection against financial loss. Customer acquisition costs continue to rise across industries, making customer retention increasingly valuable. Thus, the financial case for preventing service failures during peak periods pales in comparison to the potential revenue loss from customer attrition following a major system failure. Plus, stress testing can also give you key insights into your channel usage and your service with your vendor. “Some customers have joked that they use stress tests just to keep their carrier honest and to make sure they are getting the capacity they’re paying for,” Melvin jested. Stress testing may have fallen out of mind for many businesses since the transition to cloud-based systems. Yet, this is fueled by a false premise of a perfectly scaling cloud, according to Melvin. “You know, there’s a myth that if you’re hosted in the public cloud you don’t need to run stress tests. It’s a fallacy,” Melvin said. “Just because you’ve moved to a cloud-based UC or CC system, it won’t necessarily perform and scale the way you expect. as though it always scales the way you expect.” By switching from a reactive stance to a proactive one, you can better enable your company to scale with confidence. “Regular stress tests free up the team to be able to make important changes and updates and upgrades to the system with confidence,” Melvin explained. Bringing Confidence to Your Contact Centers As contact centers evolve to incorporate AI, virtual agents, and omnichannel capabilities, the importance of stress testing only increases. These technological advancements create additional layers of complexity and new potential points of failure that must be verified under load conditions. “Sometimes during stress tests, you press up against an issue that you’ve got to resolve before you push up against the next one to get to your full capacity,” Melvin said. Yet the iterative nature of stress testing drives continuous improvement across these evolving technologies to better prepare you for them. Voxology’s StressTest enables organizations to conduct comprehensive, automated stress tests by simulating high volumes of synthetic calls-either through the public telephone network (PSTN) or directly to a SIP endpoint-allowing for both end-to-end and infrastructure-specific testing. Its system can incrementally scale call volumes, monitor real-time performance via a dashboard, and detect issues such as latency, jitter, and audio degradation under load. Automated reporting and call recordings provide actionable insights, while Voxology’s team further analyzes problematic calls, offering practical recommendations and best practices based on observed failures. Its testing process is highly interactive, between customers and Voxology staff, collaborating live to adjust parameters, diagnose failures, and iterate on fixes, ensuring organizations can identify and resolve capacity bottlenecks before they impact real-world operations. By implementing regular stress tests, like those offered by Voxology, organizations gain the ability to measure improvement over time, a critical capability as contact center technology continues its rapid evolution. This pattern of continuous improvement, facilitated by regular testing, allows organizations to stay ahead of customer expectations rather than perpetually playing catch-up. When competitors experience service disruptions during high-volume periods, companies with well-tested, resilient infrastructure can capture market share and establish a reputation for reliability that translates directly to customer preference and loyalty. In a business environment where customer experience increasingly serves as the primary competitive battleground, the price of losing customers far outweighs the cost of keeping them."

        "title": "Proton Enters AI Race With Lumo: A Privacy-First Alternative to Big Tech Chatbots",
        "cleaned_text": "Can an AI chatbot truly protect sensitive data? Proton’s new assistant, Lumo, promises zero logs, encrypted chats, and no model training on user input Proton, the Swiss company best known for encrypted services like Proton Mail and Proton VPN, has launched its first AI chatbot, Lumo – a tool designed to compete with mainstream AI assistants while prioritising privacy and user control. Unlike tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, which often log user interactions and use them to train large language models (LLMs), Lumo is built around a “zero-logs” architecture. Proton says user data is encrypted end-to-end, never stored on its servers, and never used for training or profiling. “When we first launched Proton Mail a decade ago, our vision was to build a better alternative to Big Tech ecosystems for the benefit of all of society,” said Andy Yen, Founder and CEO of Proton . Big Tech is using AI to supercharge the collection of sensitive user data to accelerate the world’s transition to surveillance capitalism. For this reason, we believe it is essential to provide an alternative that protects privacy and serves users as opposed to exploiting them.” Privacy by Design? Conversations are not recorded server-side, and any chat history users do choose to save is encrypted such that even Proton cannot read it. The chatbot also supports a “ghost mode,” where sessions disappear entirely once closed. Key privacy features include: These measures differentiate Lumo from most other AI assistants, which typically reserve the right to use user inputs for model improvement and analytics – a practice that has drawn increasing scrutiny. Functionality and Limitations Lumo supports many of the same features as its competitors: document summarisation, email writing, code assistance, and even file uploads. Optional web search is available, but turned off by default to minimise data exposure. It integrates with other Proton services, such as Proton Drive, allowing users to analyse encrypted files. However, there is currently limited information on how its performance compares with more established AI models from OpenAI or Google, especially in terms of reasoning ability, factual accuracy, or multimodal support. Unlike ChatGPT or Gemini, Lumo is based on open-source language models, although Proton has not yet disclosed which models are in use or how they’ve been fine-tuned. AI Assistant Feature Comparison Business Model and Access Lumo is free to use – even without a Proton account – though logging in allows access to encrypted chat history across devices. A paid tier, Lumo Plus, is available for $12.99/month, offering extended chat history, file upload capabilities, and more usage. Notably, Proton is not using advertising to fund the service. Instead, it focuses on its subscription-based model, which the company argues aligns better with user privacy and transparency. In parallel with Lumo’s launch, Proton announced a broader move to relocate much of its infrastructure from Switzerland to the European Union, citing concerns over proposed Swiss surveillance laws. The company says this shift will involve over €100 million in investment to strengthen European technological sovereignty and reduce dependence on U.S. and Chinese platforms. What This Means For IT Leaders Lumo arrives at a moment when concerns about AI data privacy are growing, particularly among professionals handling sensitive information. While many users have become comfortable with mainstream chatbots, Proton is betting that a subset – including legal and medical users – will value confidentiality over convenience. However, Lumo still faces major challenges: its capabilities remain untested against leading models in terms of quality and versatility. Whether Proton can keep up with the rapid pace of AI development while maintaining its strict privacy commitments is unclear. Still, Lumo represents a notable attempt to reshape what AI can look like in a post-GDPR, post-privacy-fatigue world – one where trust, not just intelligence, becomes the key differentiator."

        "title": "Top Employee Experience Platforms for HR Leaders in 2025: Who’s Leading and Why?",
        "cleaned_text": "Constantly evolving employee experience platforms are reshaping how HR and IT leaders collaborate to engage, retain, and empower hybrid workforces As the hybrid workforce matures and employee retention tightens across industries, organisations are turning to one area for strategic advantage – employee experience (EX). From recruitment and onboarding to daily work and development, EX encompasses all aspects of workplace culture to create an environment where employees feel engaged, supported, and empowered to perform at their best. But EX in 2025 isn’t what it was even three years ago. What once lived inside HR portals and periodic surveys is now fully embedded in the tools employees use every day – Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack, and AI-powered HR platforms. The result is a dynamic, fast-evolving landscape, with everyone from collaboration giants to start-up disruptors fighting to become the heart of how companies build culture, track sentiment, and retain talent. Top Employee Experience Platforms for 2025 Choosing the right EX platform in 2025 means navigating a crowded field of powerful tools. Whether focused on culture, performance, or data-driven retention, the following highlights the top 10 platforms HR leaders are now turning to – and why. Worthy Mentions For mid-sized global teams, HiBob also offers a flexible HRIS with onboarding, performance, comp, and pulse tools – though lighter on day-to-day engagement. Centrical brings gamified learning and real-time coaching to the frontline workforce, making it ideal for retail and hourly environments. Meanwhile, Amirra is a fast-rising, AI-native platform blending onboarding, engagement, and predictive talent insights – built for the EX demands of a digital-first era. Why Zoom and Microsoft Are All-In on EX Once seen as just the pipes for communication, Zoom and Microsoft Teams are now doubling as engines of employee engagement. As remote and hybrid work redefine how teams connect, UC giants are charging hard into the EX arena – and they’re bringing their platforms with them. In 2023, Zoom acquired Workvivo, a social-style intranet built for recognition, communication, and culture. Fast-forward to 2025 and Workvivo is no longer just an add-on, it’s fully woven into Zoom Meetings and Chat. HR teams can now push pulse surveys or shout-outs live during a meeting, resulting in a more seamless blend of productivity and people strategy. On the other side of the ring is Microsoft Viva, now a mature, multi-layered experience platform embedded directly in Teams. What started as a soft-touch add-on has evolved into a robust suite: Viva Connections for intranet access, Viva Engage for social interaction, Viva Learning for growth, and Viva Glint for deep feedback loops. AI-driven nudges now surface burnout signals, while Copilot integrations personalize learning paths. The message for HR leaders is clear: the tools we use to meet, chat, and collaborate are now where we engage, recognise, and retain. And as EX becomes workplace infrastructure – not just an HR concern – Microsoft and Zoom are positioning themselves as the new cornerstones of culture, not just communication. Strategic Implications for HR and IT Leaders As employee experience platforms evolve from standalone tools into fully integrated ecosystems, HR and IT leaders face a critical crossroads. The convergence of collaboration, communication, and culture technology – exemplified by Microsoft Viva’s deep Microsoft 365 integration and Zoom’s acquisition of Workvivo – means that EX is no longer solely an HR responsibility. It’s now a shared strategic imperative demanding tight partnership between HR and IT. Integration is everything. HR teams must ensure that chosen EX platforms seamlessly connect with existing collaboration tools (like Teams, Slack, Zoom) and core HR systems to create a unified employee journey. Without this, organisations risk fragmentation that undermines engagement efforts. Data-driven insights will define success. Advanced analytics and AI-powered tools – such as Qualtrics EmployeeXM and Workday Peakon – offer predictive insights that can transform retention and talent management strategies. HR must upskill or partner with IT and data teams to harness these capabilities effectively. Personalisation and AI are the new norm. Recognition platforms like Bonusly and Motivosity now embed AI to help managers deliver timely, meaningful praise, while coaching tools such as BetterUp leverage hybrid AI-human models to scale development. Embracing these technologies requires HR leaders to rethink traditional employee development frameworks. Employee well-being is front and centre. Platforms integrating pulse surveys with wellness and micro-learning – like ThriveSparrow and Sage People – highlight the shift toward holistic employee support. IT must ensure these solutions respect privacy and data security while enabling real-time feedback. Vendor ecosystem alignment is non-negotiable. With an increasingly complex stack of EX tools, IT leaders must drive vendor evaluations that prioritize interoperability, scalability, and compliance, ensuring smooth implementation and adoption. In essence, 2025’s EX landscape calls for HR and IT leaders to become co-pilots of a digital employee experience strategy, balancing technology, culture, and data to build engaged, resilient workforces prepared for the future. What’s Next: AI, Integration, and Experience-Led Retention What’s emerging is a new consensus: employee experience is infrastructure, not an afterthought. Tools like Slack GPT (Salesforce), Centrical, and Amirra are pushing further – embedding coaching, microlearning, and wellbeing into daily tools. And as AI continues to reshape digital work, the EX battleground will likely centre on three areas: real-time sentiment analysis and personalised nudges; Integrated learning and growth tracking; and seamless experiences across UC and productivity stacks. In this new landscape, HR is no longer a back-office function – it’s become a digital experience architect that could just shape the very soul of an organisation."

        "title": "Gemini Update Can See It Read Your WhatsApp Messages: What Does This Mean for Your Compliance?",
        "cleaned_text": "The new Google Gemini update aims to bring enhanced capabilities to phone messaging, but it also opens a compliance loophole In a move ostensibly aimed at improving user experience, Google has announced that its Gemini AI assistant can now “help you use Phone, Messages, WhatsApp, and Utilities on your phone.” The functionality allows users to summon Gemini and issue voice commands such as “Send a WhatsApp message to [contact],” with the AI assistant executing these actions directly. Now, while this update does not exactly risk compliance—as Google maintains that under normal circumstances, Gemini cannot read or summarize WhatsApp messages—certain crossovers with other Google products mean that the issue of compliance becomes unclear. Implementation and Potential Compliance Issues The technical architecture behind Gemini’s integration across a phone’s messaging systems reveals several layers of data access that compliance teams must understand. Google’s system operates through multiple pathways, with the primary integration allowing basic message-sending functionality while maintaining what the company describes as privacy protection. However, where this becomes unclear is the secondary access layer through Google Assistant and Utilities apps. When these companion applications assist Gemini with WhatsApp functions, they create a pathway for message content access that bypasses the standard privacy limitations. This collaboration , in theory, allows the system to view complete message threads, process images within conversations, and analyze notification content to provide contextual responses. The distinction is crucial: it’s not Gemini alone that poses the compliance risk, but rather the interconnected ecosystem of Google applications working together. This collaborative approach means that users who believe they’re simply using Gemini for basic messaging tasks may inadvertently trigger deeper content access when Google Assistant or Utilities apps provide “assistance.” Even when users disable Gemini Apps Activity, Google retains data for up to 72 hours under the justification of maintaining the “safety and security of Gemini Apps” and enabling contextual responses. This retention period creates a compliance window where sensitive business communications remain accessible to Google’s systems, regardless of user privacy preferences. The company’s statement that chats won’t be “reviewed or used to improve AI models” when Apps Activity is disabled provides limited reassurance, given the broad access permissions still in place. Compliance Implications Across Regulated Industries Although Google states this update can offer users greater capabilities, its introduction has created a loophole for companies trying to keep their WhatsApp conversations compliant. For instance, if data from a company’s mobile WhatsApp chats—used by frontline workers as part of the overarching UC communication system—accidentally falls into this mechanism, then that company could risk violating regulations like GDPR and the right to be forgotten, as they would have lost control over that data. Financial services organizations face particularly acute challenges with this development, as many rely on WhatsApp for client communications while operating under strict regulatory frameworks like GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations such as MiFID II or SOX compliance. The potential for AI systems to access, process, and retain client financial discussions creates audit trails that may not align with existing data governance policies. Healthcare organizations using WhatsApp for any patient-related communications now confront potential HIPAA violations if Gemini’s access extends to protected health information. Strategic Response and Future Compliance Despite this only affecting mobile WhatsApp use, it still poses an issue for companies that deploy the messaging app as part of their UC tech stack. Organizations must develop comprehensive response strategies that address both immediate compliance requirements and longer-term implications of AI integration in communication platforms. The first priority involves conducting thorough risk assessments to identify which business communications might be affected by Gemini’s access capabilities and evaluating whether existing privacy impact assessments adequately address these new data flows. Policy updates become essential, with organizations needing to revise mobile device management policies, communication guidelines, and employee training programs to address AI-mediated message access. For those wishing to avoid more complex workarounds at the cost of some convenience , they can turn off Gemini Apps Activity. This will still retain user data for up to 72 hours , however . Yet, for those who want to remove Gemini entirely and avoid being caught off guard by future compliance-risking changes, a more complex workaround exists to remove Gemini from Android devices. Keeping Compliant Amid Change Looking forward, this development signals a broader trend toward AI integration across communication platforms that will require ongoing compliance monitoring. As other major tech companies develop similar AI capabilities, organizations must build adaptive compliance frameworks that can respond to rapidly evolving AI access patterns while maintaining regulatory adherence. The Google Gemini–WhatsApp integration ultimately represents a fundamental shift in how businesses must approach communication privacy and AI governance. While the technology offers potential productivity benefits, the compliance implications require careful consideration and proactive risk management strategies. Organizations that act swiftly to assess and address these challenges will be better positioned to navigate the evolving landscape of AI-integrated business communications while maintaining regulatory compliance and client trust."

        "title": "When Regulators Come Calling: Why Your Current Communication Setup Won’t Stand Up to Scrutiny",
        "cleaned_text": "Hybrid work, mobile-first communication, AI-driven platforms—and growing regulatory pressure. Are your voice and collaboration tools keeping pace? Across every major industry—from financial services to healthcare to government—regulators are watching. And they’re not impressed. As enterprises embrace hybrid work, mobile-first cultures, and increasingly AI-powered collaboration tools, they’re also creating dangerous gaps in their compliance posture. Data retention, call recording, and policy enforcement are under the spotlight as regulators intensify scrutiny. And many organizations, especially those relying on patchwork solutions or personal devices, are quietly falling behind. “Companies often overlook the extent or the options that their employees have to communicate—and those modes that require compliance and security controls,” says Doug Jones, AVP of Product Management, Voice & Collaboration at AT&T. “You need to think about this end to end—across any device, any app, any mode of communication.” The Evolving Compliance Landscape: More Devices, More Risk Five years ago, enterprise compliance strategies largely focused on email and traditional phone systems. Now, regulators expect organizations to demonstrate control across a vast landscape of communication channels: For highly regulated sectors such as finance and healthcare, the bar is rising fast. “Remote work has enabled flexibility – but also created a nightmare for companies trying to ensure compliance across all these modes of communication,” says Jones. “Now you’ve got half a dozen different ways an employee might interact with clients or partners. They all need to be secure—and compliant.” The Hidden Risks of Personal Devices Many organizations embraced BYOD strategies early in the hybrid work era, hoping to balance flexibility with cost savings. But today, personal device usage creates significant blind spots—especially in high-stakes environments like trading floors or healthcare contact centers. While BYOD can be an enabler, Jones warns that oversight and policy enforcement must be fully integrated—not an afterthought. “Just because a UC app is installed on a device doesn’t mean it’s the only way users will communicate,” he explains. “Without tight integration, employees can bypass apps and use native calling—and that’s where compliance risk creeps in.” AT&T and Microsoft Teams Phone: Securing Communications End-to-End To help enterprises meet this challenge, AT&T has developed deep integrations with leading UC platforms—including Microsoft Teams Phone. “We’ve worked with our UC partners and integrated AT&T wireless and wireline networks to provide true end-to-end security and compliance,” says Jones. “When you combine native calling capabilities with UC apps through fixed-mobile convergence, now you’ve got that embedded compliance and security—no matter how the call is placed.” That matters not just for call recording and data retention, but also for advanced AI capabilities—like transcription and intelligent recap tools—where regulators now expect auditable records. Learning from the Front Lines: Finance as a Cautionary Tale Recent regulatory enforcement actions in the U.S. banking sector provide a cautionary tale. Public reports have highlighted multi-million-dollar fines imposed on banks where personal device use and non-compliant communication went unmonitored. Jones cites the finance vertical as a key driver of demand for AT&T integrated solutions: “We’ve seen firsthand how large financial institutions are now coming to us, wanting to secure all forms of communication—whether it’s a UC app, a mobile device, or a fixed line. They want one unified compliance posture across the board.” By combining centralized policy control, secure voice transport, and native integration with Microsoft Teams Phone and Cisco Webex , AT&T is helping enterprises avoid the painful fines and reputational damage that can come from compliance gaps. What CIOs and Compliance Leaders Need to Hear For CIOs, compliance leaders, and technology buyers, the message is clear: Your roadmap starts here—with secure, enterprise-grade connectivity. “If you’re building an AI strategy or modernizing collaboration, you need to start with the plumbing first,” says Jones. “Consolidate redundant lines, optimize connectivity, and embed compliance from the foundation up. If you don’t, all the advanced features you layer on top could put your organization at risk.” The AT&T mantra? “Your roadmap starts here—with connectivity. Everything else, including AI, is just enriching the features of whatever platform you choose.” In a world of ever-expanding communication channels, getting the basics right has never mattered more. Because when regulators come calling, excuses won’t be enough."

        "title": "Microsoft SharePoint Servers Under Attack: Key Takeaways to Stay Secure",
        "cleaned_text": "Microsoft SharePoint has been subject to ongoing attacks, with organizations across the world affected Microsoft has issued an alert about a serious security breach affecting SharePoint on-premises servers, warning organizations worldwide that active attacks exploit zero-day vulnerability in their collaboration platform. The tech giant confirmed that hackers have successfully compromised tens of thousands of servers used by government agencies, universities, energy companies, and private enterprises globally, with US and UK government agencies confirming reports. “Microsoft is aware of active attacks targeting on-premises SharePoint Server customers by exploiting vulnerabilities partially addressed by the July Security Update,” The company said on a blog post. This revelation represents one of the most significant threats to Microsoft’s enterprise ecosystem in recent months, with the potential to impact critical business operations and sensitive data across multiple sectors. Additionally, the scope of potential damage extends beyond SharePoint itself, as the platform typically integrates deeply with other Microsoft services including Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive, allowing attacks to expand across workflows. Examining the Attack Federal cybersecurity authorities, such as the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), have said the scope of the attack is still being assessed but have characterized the threat as urgent and ongoing. What is known already, however, is that unlike typical security flaws that might allow limited access, this exploit grants attackers comprehensive control over affected SharePoint installations. This has enabled them to steal authentication keys that let them back in even after system reboots and security patches have been applied. Furthermore, due to SharePoint’s extensive integration with Microsoft 365 services, attackers can pivot to access email systems, file repositories, and communication platforms. This lateral movement capability transforms a single server compromise into an organization-wide security incident, potentially exposing years of stored communications, documents, and business intelligence. Two US agencies, institutions in China, a local government agency in Spain, and a university in Brazil are reported to have been hit by this attack, highlighting the scope of the issue. An official in an affected organization in the US said the attackers had “hijacked” a repository of documents made available to residents to help them understand the workings of government. The agency is currently unable to access the material in question, which the raiders may or may not have deleted. According to spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security and CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy, the hack came after Microsoft fixed a security flaw in SharePoint earlier this month, which inadvertently alerted the hackers that they might be able to exploit a similar vulnerability. McCarthy said CISA was alerted to the hack by a cyber research firm on Friday and flagged it to Microsoft. What to Do to Protect Yourself Microsoft has explained how the exploit specifically targets on-premises SharePoint 2016, 2019, and Subscription Edition installations, while cloud-hosted SharePoint Online services remain unaffected due to their different architecture and security controls. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it provides unauthenticated access to SharePoint servers, essentially allowing attackers to bypass normal login requirements entirely. Once inside, threat actors can extract authentication tokens and certificates that grant them persistent access to the compromised environment. These stolen credentials remain valid even after the initial vulnerability is patched, or a system is rebooted, creating a scenario where organizations must not only apply security updates but also conduct comprehensive credential rotation and system auditing. Microsoft has responded by releasing emergency patches for SharePoint 2019 and Subscription Edition servers. To mitigate potential attacks, Microsoft recommends five key steps customers should undertake. With Microsoft’s response timeline to applying any deeper backend fixes to this issue still unclear, and additional updates for the affected SharePoint 2016 currently in development, such remediation efforts like rotating keys may be some of the only options IT teams can apply on their side to keep their environments secure. Keeping On-Premises Secure Amid Attacks The coordinated attacks against Microsoft SharePoint and Exchange servers represent more than isolated security incidents; they mark a strategic escalation in threats facing enterprise collaboration infrastructure. The sophistication of these attacks, combined with their targeting of high-value organizational assets, indicates that threat actors have identified collaborative platforms as critical vulnerabilities in modern business operations. The technical characteristics of these attacks, including their persistence mechanisms, lateral movement capabilities, and ability of attackers to maintain access even after patching, are a wake-up call for organizations to consider additional procedures as part of their security posture. With Microsoft recently eliminating over 1,000 scenarios of high-privilege access , it’s clear scenarios like these are some that Microsoft has been working toward eliminating. Yet despite its promise to improve security, with new initiatives and CEO pay taking a hit over previous failures, it seems Microsoft still has some work to do in keeping customer environments safe."

        "title": "Over Half of Fortune 100 Firms Now Mandate Full-Time RTO: What Now?",
        "cleaned_text": "A dramatic shift is underway among America’s corporate elite as hybrid work falls out of favour. With new data from JLL showing full-time return-to-office mandates surging among Fortune 100 giants, the implications for CIOs, CTOs, HR heads and C-suite leadership are profound Over half of Fortune 100 businesses now mandate their employees return to the office full-time for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. The flexible work era appears to be losing its shine, at least among the most prominent players in corporate America. According to fresh data from commercial real estate giant Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), 54 percent of companies now require employees to be in the office full time, a colossal jump from just five percent two years ago. This dramatic pivot is detailed in JLL’s latest 25 Office Market Insights report for Q2 2025, which reveals the average mandated office presence now stands at 3.8 days a week, up from 2.6 days in Q2 2023. The trend signposts a decisive retreat from the hybrid working arrangements that defined post-pandemic office culture. Just 41 percent of Fortune 100 firms now support hybrid work, a significant drop from 78 percent two years ago. Of the ten largest employers in the Fortune 100, seven demand in-person attendance at least four days a week, and the top three—Amazon, Walmart, and UnitedHealth Group—have reinstated full-time, five-day office mandates. Big-name companies are leading the charge. Google, Amazon, and Starbucks have not only tightened their RTO policies but are reportedly offering cash incentives to remote workers to either relocate closer to their offices or leave the company. Albeit, Amazon has been struggling to implement its full-time RTO mandate due to a lack of space in US cities. JPMorgan Chase followed suit in January, mandating all staff return full time, while the new Trump administration has enforced a five-day in-office rule for federal workers. What C-Suite and IT Leaders Need to Know Now For CIOs, CTOs, COOs, and members of enterprise tech-buying committees, this sharp return to physical workspaces reshapes several strategic priorities, from IT infrastructure to real estate spending, security protocols, and employee experience. First, network and workplace tech investments must evolve again. Over the past three years, many firms have optimised their environments for distributed work, investing heavily in collaboration tools, cloud-first infrastructure, and endpoint security. Now, leaders must recalibrate for hybrid parity and in-person productivity, ensuring seamless connectivity across both in-office and legacy remote tech stacks. Second, there’s a renewed pressure to rationalise office space and tech real estate spend. JLL’s report shows only marginal gains in actual attendance despite stricter mandates, suggesting empty-desk inefficiencies persist. Leaders may need to reimagine how physical space is used, investing in smart occupancy tools, desk-booking platforms, and modernised meeting spaces to reflect evolving patterns of presence. HR and IT also need to work closely together to address employee engagement and attrition risks. The rise of “task-masking”, where employees post videos pretending to be busy at their desks to maintain appearances, can’t be dismissed as just TikTok fodder. It illustrates a more profound disconnect between leadership mandates and employee mindset. If RTO policies are to succeed, they must be paired with cultural incentives, flexibility within structure, and compelling in-office experiences that justify the commute. Finally, enterprise tech buyers should scrutinise the implications of shifting work modes on long-term vendor relationships. Platforms that once held prime position for remote support may now need to integrate more deeply with physical workplace systems, from access control to in-office analytics. Is the Remote Work Revolution Over? Not Quite However, while the return to the office may be gathering pace, it’s not a simple rewind. This RTO movement is far from universal or unstoppable. A Gallup poll shows that 51 percent of Americans in remote-compatible jobs still work from home at least part of the time, a sign that flexibility remains a staple among smaller or more progressive employers. Meanwhile, it’s clearer than ever that workers treasure flexible and hybrid working as a key priority when choosing jobs, if not the key priority. Owl Labs’ State of Hybrid Work Report 2024 signposted the importance of flexible working for the modern workforce. It found that almost half of workers would quit their roles if their organisation ended hybrid working and instituted a full-time in-office policy. This materialised after Amazon announced its full-time RTO mandate . Blind, a forum for verified tech workers, surveyed 2,500 Amazon employees in the aftermath of the announcement. The results showed that 91 percent of respondents were unhappy with the new RTO mandate, and nearly three-fourths (73 percent) were considering seeking employment elsewhere. Putting the remote/hybrid work genie back into the lamp seems improbable despite the severity of these mandates. For tech and executive leadership, this moment demands a nuanced, data-informed rethink of how we define work, presence, productivity, and value in the modern enterprise."

        "title": "The Goldilocks Factor: Why Your Growing Business Needs a ‘Just Right’ Contact Center Solution",
        "cleaned_text": "Discovering the Sweet Spot Between Basic Tools and Enterprise Complexity For companies with 50-500 employees, there’s a critical moment when customer communications reach a tipping point. They’re handling hundreds of daily interactions across multiple channels, yet many don’t identify as having a “contact center.” I spoke to Unified Communications and Contact Center vendor GoTo to discuss that ‘Goldilocks moment’ when businesses realize they’re too big for basic solutions but not ready for enterprise complexity. Joseph Walsh, VP Global Marketing at GoTo , has seen this transformation countless times. “The vast majority of businesses are struggling with customer experience,” he explains. “In the US, if you look at Forrester’s Consumer Experience Index, US customers are having the worst experiences in over a decade.” The Identity Crisis: When Customer Service Becomes a Contact Center Most growing businesses don’t wake up one day and decide they need a contact center. Instead, they gradually cross invisible thresholds that signal it’s time for more sophisticated customer communication tools. Walsh identifies five critical questions that reveal when a business has entered contact center territory: “When businesses can sit down and ask themselves these five questions, they often realize they’re already in the world of contact center software, even if they don’t see themselves as a traditional contact center.” — Joseph Walsh, VP Global Marketing, GoTo The Goldilocks Advantage: Why Size Matters The companies winning in today’s competitive landscape aren’t necessarily the biggest—they’re the ones smart enough to recognize their position in the “Goldilocks zone.” This sweet spot offers unique advantages: Customer Expectations Have Evolved Modern consumers carry powerful devices that give them access to advanced AI and instant gratification. They expect businesses to deliver smartphone-level experiences, including 24/7 service and personalized interactions. Technology Has Democratized What once required 18-month implementations and massive budgets now takes days to deploy for hundreds, not thousands, of dollars monthly. Agility Advantage Unlike enterprises bogged down by complex processes, growing businesses can implement unified solutions quickly without overwhelming technical resources. Walsh emphasizes the importance of matching technology to your actual needs: “You don’t want to go out and buy software for a 2,000-strong contact center if you’ve got 20 people dealing with customers daily. We see customers coming off big box enterprise offerings because they’re complex, require lots of tech resources, and are expensive.” For companies with 50-500 employees, a good rule of thumb suggests 10-15% are customer-facing daily. This translates to roughly 5-75 people who need contact center capabilities—a perfect fit for right-sized solutions. The Practical Path Forward Match Team Size and Roles Choose software that scales from a few users to several dozen, allowing growth without overpaying for unused capacity. Focus on Essential Channels Don’t implement everything at once. Start with core needs and add channels as your business grows. Prioritize Ease of Use Your solution should be simple for teams to adopt and for limited tech resources to deploy. Ensure Integration Capabilities Look for off-the-shelf integrations with existing tools like HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics, or Salesforce. Demand Flexible Pricing Pay for what you need now, with the ability to scale without massive upfront commitments. The AI Advantage: Practical Technology That Actually Works The AI conversation often intimidates growing businesses, but Walsh advocates for “practical AI”—simple, easily deployable applications that provide instant benefits. “We’re focusing on practical AI—simple, easy to deploy applications that give you instant benefit. Some of this comes within your existing technology. Many organizations feel they haven’t started their AI journey, but there’s a lot they can probably turn on with their existing tech stack.” Quick AI Wins Include: GoTo’s AI Receptionist, for example, can handle 15-20% of incoming calls by automating responses to frequently asked questions. It can be deployed in 24 hours and costs hundreds, not thousands, of dollars. The Best AI is Invisible AI – Walsh notes that the most effective AI features are often the ones users don’t realize are powered by artificial intelligence: “Technology should never drive what you do. It should just enable what you do.” Measuring Success: Real Impact for Real Businesses When companies embrace their contact center identity and implement right-sized solutions, the results are measurable: “When you have the right data, the right insights, and the right context available to people, employees are much more informed and can get answers to customers the first time. This creates benefits on both the customer side and the employee side.” Ready to Find Your Perfect-Fit Solution? If your growing business is handling customer communications across multiple disconnected systems, you might already be operating a contact center without realizing it. The question isn’t whether you need contact center technology—it’s whether you’ll continue managing with inadequate tools or embrace solutions designed for your size.

        "title": "Slack’s New AI Features Could Help You Catch Up, Cut Jargon, and Stay Organised",
        "cleaned_text": "Slack’s latest AI features aim to reduce context-switching, clarify internal communication, and improve information discoverability As the AI race in workplace apps heats up, Slack has announced a new set of updates as part of its continuing efforts to integrate machine learning. The features include AI-assisted search, automated meeting transcriptions and summaries, channel recaps, message explanation tools, and an AI writing assistant for Slack Canvas. AI That Understands Your Work The most immediate update will be an AI-enhanced search function that can pull relevant content not only from Slack channels but also from integrated third-party applications, including Google Drive, Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, and Confluence. Available to users on Slack’s Business and Enterprise plans, this unified search taps into organisational knowledge across platforms, allowing users to find relevant files, messages, and discussions – regardless of where they originated. This is not just a productivity win for individual users. For IT departments overseeing digital collaboration tools, it presents a scalable way to reduce information silos and promote a more connected workplace. With employees often toggling between a half-dozen apps in a single workflow, centralising search across systems could dramatically improve efficiency and reduce context-switching. Goodbye Jargon? One of the more intriguing updates is the platform’s new message context tool, which uses AI to explain acronyms, internal tools, and workplace jargon. When a user hovers over an unfamiliar phrase, Slack will instantly pull in context based on the organisation’s unique vocabulary and past conversations. This is more than just a convenience, it’s potentially an onboarding breakthrough. New employees often struggle to ramp up in environments thick with team-specific shorthand and internal project code names, and automating this translation layer could foster a more inclusive, user-friendly environment from day one. Huddles Get Smarter Slack’s Huddles, the platform’s lightweight voice and video chat feature, is also getting an AI-powered overhaul. Users can now access full transcripts of Huddle conversations, with the system automatically generating summaries of what was discussed. Even more notably, Slack’s AI will highlight key action items raised during the call, giving teams a clear next-step roadmap without requiring someone to take manual notes. Catching Up is Now Instant Missed a morning thread? Slack’s new message summaries are designed to help users catch up on channel and thread conversations with a glance. Instead of scrolling through dozens of messages, they’ll now get a concise AI-generated recap that outlines the key points. This is particularly useful in large, global organisations where teams are spread across time zones and channels are constantly active. For IT leaders, this could mean a dramatic drop in redundant pings and clarification requests, lightening the communication load on already stretched teams. Slack is also rolling out AI-generated user profile summaries, giving quick insight into a colleague’s role, recent work, and ongoing projects. This adds context to inter-team collaboration, especially in large or rapidly scaling companies where you might not know every name in a channel. Additionally, a new feature in the Activities tab will highlight action items embedded in messages where a user is mentioned. If someone tags you in a message with a request, follow-up, or deadline, Slack’s AI will automatically extract and summarise what you need to do. What It Means for IT Leaders While these AI features are flashy on the surface, they represent a deeper shift in how IT leaders must approach communication tooling and employee enablement. Security and Compliance: With AI now parsing and summarising sensitive conversations, IT teams must ensure that privacy controls, data retention policies, and access permissions are clearly defined and enforced. Slack’s AI features rely heavily on organizational data – making governance more critical than ever. User Training and Adoption: These tools won’t reach their full potential unless employees know how to use them effectively. IT leaders will need to work with HR and communications teams to provide training, onboarding modules, and support channels to help employees adapt to AI-powered workflows. Integration Oversight: As Slack now taps into data from external apps, leaders must ensure APIs are securely managed and that integrated tools follow organizational policies around data sharing and storage. Cost-Benefit Considerations: While many of these features are reserved for Business and Enterprise plan users, organisations will need to evaluate ROI – particularly as vendors increasingly put advanced AI capabilities behind paywalls. Workplace Culture Impact: The AI that explains jargon or highlights team roles can also help build bridges across departments. IT leaders should consider how such tools influence workplace transparency, collaboration, and inclusion. The Bottom Line Slack’s latest AI push is more than a collection of cool features – it’s a signal that workplace communication is evolving from passive to proactive. As AI continues to weave itself deeper into the fabric of enterprise software, tools like Slack are becoming not just hubs for conversation, but engines for clarity, context, and action. For IT leaders using the platform, the question isn’t whether to adopt it – but how quickly you can deploy, govern, and empower your teams to use it effectively."

        "title": "Mercedes Enables Teams Video Calls While Driving: Are Car Cockpits the Next Huddle Space?",
        "cleaned_text": "Mercedes-Benz CLA models is bringing extended UC capbilities to cars by allowing video calls whilst driving Mercedes-Benz has announced a game-changing integration that allows drivers to participate in Microsoft Teams video calls using an in-car camera while actively driving. The integration will debut on the new CLA model as part of Mercedes-Benz’s summer productivity enhancements. This marks the first time a major automaker has enabled video conferencing capabilities during vehicle operation, representing a significant shift from existing safety protocols that typically restrict such functionality to parked vehicles only. This announcement signals how personal vehicle cockpits are increasingly being positioned as the next huddle space, with Mercedes’ innovation building on similar moves by other automakers. Teams Calls in the CLA Cockpit Accessed as an app on the in-car infotainment system, the Teams call—when activated—uses the car’s console camera to capture the video feed and make it visible to meeting participants, similar to traditional office setups. What changes is that the driver’s video view becomes limited once the car begins moving. The Mercedes-Benz Teams integration operates through a carefully designed system of safety controls and technical limitations, aimed at minimizing driving distractions while maintaining remote meeting participation. Once in motion, the car’s video feed becomes one-way, and the driver loses the ability to view shared screens or presentation materials included in the call. This selective approach attempts to balance productivity with road safety. Allowing drivers to access shared materials while driving would increase the risk of distraction by encouraging them to take their eyes off the road. Beyond Teams integration, Mercedes-Benz is also partnering with Microsoft to embed Microsoft 365 Copilot into its latest vehicles, another first of its kind in a car. This AI-powered voice assistant could allow drivers to summarize emails, manage tasks, and perform various productivity functions—all without manual interface interaction. The automaker frames this development as transforming vehicles into a “third workspace” alongside the office and home, meaning participating in meetings here could become both acceptable and routine. The Automotive Huddle Space Phenomenon As high-end cars have developed more advanced audiovisual systems, automakers increasingly view their interiors as ideal environments for busy professionals to complete tasks while on the move. In response, more automakers are integrating enterprise-grade UC tools directly into vehicle systems. Although Microsoft’s integration with Mercedes-Benz is the first to allow Teams video calls during active driving, the concept of using a car’s cockpit as a huddle space has already been explored. In 2022, Zoom announced a partnership with Tesla to bring its video conferencing platform to Tesla vehicles. Just last month, Zoom extended similar functionality to Ford and Lincoln cars , enabling meetings without the need for a phone. However, Ford restricts full video capability to when the vehicle is parked. It’s clear that UC providers see the cockpit’s potential as a professional collaboration space—as do automakers. Yet Mercedes-Benz’s latest announcement demonstrates a willingness to test the limits of this new mobile workplace compared to more traditional, desk-based alternatives. The Future of Mobile Productivity Platforms While the growing integration of meetings into car environments introduces new etiquette and expectations that enterprises must eventually address, the Mercedes-Benz and Microsoft partnership highlights a broader shift: car cockpits are being seen as capable huddle spaces for modern professionals. Microsoft’s involvement—through both Teams integration and Copilot functionality—represents a strategic move to expand its enterprise tools into automotive environments. Where this goes a step further is in exploring how much of the full meeting experience can truly be replicated within a moving vehicle.
